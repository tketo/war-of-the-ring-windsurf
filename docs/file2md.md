Everywhere he looked he saw the signs

of war. The Misty Mountains were

crawling like anthills: Orcs were

issuing out of a thousand holes.

Under the boughs of Mirkwood

there was deadly strife of

Elves and Men and fell beasts.

The land of the Beornings was

aflame; a cloud was over Moria;

smoke rose on the borders of

Lórien. Horsemen were galloping

on the grass of Rohan; wolves

poured from Isengard. From the

havens of Harad ships of war

put out to sea; and out of the

East Men were moving endlessly:

swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon

horses, chariots of chieftains and laden

wains. All the power of the Dark Lord was

in motion.

The Fellowship

of the Ring

by J.R.R. Tolkien,

Book II, Chapter 10.

Column 1 - page 3
Welcome to the War of the Ring strategy board game.

War of the Ring is a game for two to four players, based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings™ .

The players take part in the struggle of the armies of the
Free Peoples and the heroic Companions of the Fellowship
of the Ring against the dark host of the Shadow and the
powerful Minions of the Dark Lord.

In a two-player game, each opponent will lead either the
Free Peoples or the armies of the Shadow, while in a three-
or four-player game, the players will be organized in two
teams, each team controlling either faction.

In each game of War of the Ring, the player controlling
the Shadow attempts to use his superior military power to
conquer Middle-earth.

At his command gather Sauron’s legions of Orcs and Trolls,
the forces of the wizard Saruman, and the hosts of the
Southrons and Easterlings, set to bring darkness over the
West.

Against this onslaught, the Free Peoples player leads an
allegiance of Elves, Dwarves, the riders of Rohan, men of
Gondor, and men from the North—a fragile union trying
to defend the last free realms of Middle-earth, and to gain
precious time to allow the success of the Quest of the Ring-
bearers.

While armies clash, the nine Companions of the Fellowship
of the Ring travel towards the very heart of the domains of
the Dark Lord—Mount Doom—to destroy the One Ring
in the Mountain of Fire.

Controlled by the Free Peoples player, the Fellowship is
his true chance of winning, as the military forces of the
Shadow will be vanquished together with their master if the
Ring is undone. But the Quest is fraught with ever greater
perils, as the Darkness falls over Middle-earth...

In the end, one side will emerge victorious.

If the Shadow conquers enough of its enemies’ cities and
strongholds, or if the Ring-bearers fail and are corrupted,
Darkness will triumph.

If the Fellowship succeeds in destroying the Ring before
this happens, or the armies of the Free Peoples succeed in
turning the tide and conquering the enemy’s strongholds
themselves, the fall of the Dark Lord is at hand...

NUMBER OF PLAYERS
War of the Ring is a game for 2 to 4 players. The forces
involved in the conflict are divided into two sides: the
Free Peoples and the Shadow. When playing with three
players, one player controls the Free Peoples and the
remaining two control the Shadow, sharing tasks. When
playing with four players, all participants evenly share the
forces of the two sides.

Please note that these rules refer to games played with
only two players. To play games with more than two
players, see Chapter 11, Multiplayer Rules (page 45).

NOTES ON THE SECOND EDITION
This new edition of the game introduces a few subtle
but important changes from the First Edition. They
are summarized here for the benefit of players already
familiar with the First Edition:

- Character Abilities: Gandalf the Grey, Gollum,
Meriadoc Brandybuck, Peregrin Took and the
Witch-king now have modified special abilities
(see their Character cards). The changes to
Gandalf the Grey (Guide ability) and the Witch-
king (mustering pre-requisites, “Sorcerer” ability)
are especially important to take notice of.

- Event Cards: Many Event cards have been
revised to improve their effectiveness, or simplify
their use. The “Ents Awake,” “Paths of the
Woses” and “The Last Battle” cards have
modified effects.

- Army Setup: The setup for the Dwarves has
been modified (see page 16).

- Action Dice: The Shadow player must allocate a
minimum of 1 Action die to the Hunt if the Free
Peoples player placed at least one Action die in the
Hunt Box in the previous turn (see pages 18-19).

- Use of Combat Cards: Combat cards are now
chosen and played using a modified sequence (see
page 29).

- The Hunt: There is a new sequence for the Hunt
resolution, to streamline the application of Event
cards and Special Abilities (see pages 41-42).

- Entering Mordor: To enter Mordor, it is now
sufficient that the Ring-bearers are located
in Minas Morgul or Morannon, without the
requirement of declaring the Fellowship. As a
consequence, the Fellowship can enter Mordor
even if it is not Hidden (see page 43).

CHAPTER III : SETTING UP THE GAME

Before you start playing, you should decide who will
play the Free Peoples and who will play the Shadow.
Then, get the game ready to play by following these steps.

STEP 1

Place the game board on a suitable surface, possibly large
enough to leave some room along the sides of the board
(to place discarded cards and eliminated pieces and to roll

dice).

STEP 2

Place the Ring-bearers figure on Rivendell, its starting

STEP 3

Place the Fellowship Progress Counter on Step 0 of
the Fellowship Track, with the “Hidden” side up. The
Corruption Counter is also placed on Step 0 of the same track.

STEP 4

Place all Companion Cards in the Guide of the Fellowship
Box, with the Gandalf the Grey Character Card on top,
as he is the starting Guide of the Fellowship. Set aside the
cards for Aragorn – Heir to Isildur, Gandalf the White,
and Gollum for later use.

STEP 5

Place all the Companion figures and their counters in the
The Fellowship of the Ring Box. Set aside the Gollum
figure for later use.

STEP 6

Place the three Elven Ring counters in the Free Peoples’
Elven Rings Box of the game board with the “Ring” side up.

STEP 7

Set aside all Shadow Minion Cards (the Witch-king,
Saruman, and the Mouth of Sauron) and the corresponding
figures for later use.

STEP 8

Separate the Free Peoples and Shadow Event Cards into
Character and Strategy Decks according to the back of
each card, shuffle them separately, and place them on the
corresponding areas of the game board.

STEP 9

Put the Standard Hunt Tiles (beige) in a cup or other
opaque container: this is the Hunt Pool. Set aside the
Special Hunt Tiles (blue and red) for later use.

STEP 10

Give seven red Shadow Action Dice to the Shadow player
and four blue Free Peoples Action Dice to the Free Peoples
player. Set aside the remaining Action Dice for later use. Set
aside the five Combat Dice.

STEP 11

Place the Political Counter for each Free Peoples Nation
on its starting point on the Political Track. All of the Free
Peoples Nations’ Political Counters except for that of the
Elves are placed with the “Passive” side up. The Political
Counters of the Elves and all the Shadow Army Nations
are placed with the “Active” side up. As indicated by the
symbols on the track, place the Rohan, the North, the
Elven, and the Dwarven Nations’ Political Counters in
the top box, place the Gondor and Southron/Easterling
Political Counters in the second box from the top, and
finally place the Sauron and Isengard Political Counters in
the third box from the top—immediately above the “At War” box.

STEP 12

Sort all the plastic figures by their color and their type and
follow the Army Setup diagram on pages 16-17 to place
each Nation’s initial Army units and Leaders. Set aside any
remaining figures to use as reinforcements, paying attention
not to mix them with pieces eliminated from play as the
game progresses. Set aside the Army counters for use later
Keep all the remaining components in the box; they will be
used later in the game.

THE GAME TURN

Phase 1) Recover Action Dice and Draw Event Cards
Each player recovers the
Action Dice he used in the
previous turn, plus any dice
which were added to the
Action Dice Pool and minus
any dice which were removed
from the pool.
Then, each player draws 2
cards, one from each of their
respective Event Decks.

Phase 2) Fellowship Phase
The Free Peoples player may
now declare the position of the
Fellowship.
If the Fellowship is declared in
a City or Stronghold of a Free
Peoples Nation, that Nation
is activated (if the Nation
is showing “Passive” on the
Political Track, flip the Nation
to “Active”) and the Ring-
bearers may be healed.
Also, during this phase, the
Free Peoples player may
change the Guide of the
Fellowship.

Phase 3) Hunt Allocation
The Shadow player may now
place a number of Action Dice
in the Hunt box located on
the game board. The Shadow
player must place at least one
Action Die if the Free Peoples
player retrieved at least 1 die
from the Hunt Box during
Phase 1. He may allocate only
as many dice as the number
of Companions remaining in
the Fellowship. These dice are
not rolled during the following
Action Roll phase.

Phase 4) Action Roll
Players roll their Action Dice
(except the dice already in the
Hunt box). Then, the Shadow
player immediately takes all the
rolled dice showing the “Eye”
result and adds them to the
Hunt box.

Phase 5) Action Resolution
This phase is the primar y game
phase of the War of the Ring
board game.
It is during this phase that
players will utilize the Action
Dice results to move their
Characters and Armies on the
game board, or to take other
impor tant actions.
The results of the rolled Action
Dice dictate the actions the
players can take during this
phase. Starting with the Free
Peoples player, the two players
alternate actions, each taking one
action by selecting and removing
one of his available die results.
If a player has fewer unused
Action Dice than his opponent
(typically the Free Peoples player
will have fewer Action Dice than
the Shadow player), he can pass
instead of taking an action, thus
allowing the opponent to take
another action.
If a player r uns out of actions
before his opponent has done
the same, the opponent takes
all his remaining actions, one
after the other.
Each time the Free Peoples
player uses an Action Die to
move the Fellowship, he places
that die in the Hunt box after
completing the action. All
other used dice are set aside
until next turn.
The use of each dif ferent
Action Die is described in
more detail later.

Phase 6) Victory Check
Players now check to see
whether either player has
achieved the Militar y Victor y
Conditions. If not, a new
game turn begins.
When all the activities required
by the dif ferent phases have
been concluded, the turn is over
and another turn begins (unless
one of the players has achieved
his Victor y Conditions, in
which case the game ends).

GAME PIECES

PLASTIC FIGURES
The Armies fighting for Middle-earth and the heroes and
monsters that lead them are represented in the game by
plastic figures.

Armies
The bulk of the armed forces of a Nation are represented
by Army units.

The Army units of a Nation are further divided into either
Regular or Elite units, where the first category represents
a fighting force of average warriors and the second a host of
chosen fighters or powerful monsters.

A single Army unit corresponds to a variable number of
warriors, from a few hundred expert fighters to thousands
of Orcs. In game terms, all units of a kind (Regular or
Elite) have the same fighting capabilities as any other of the
same kind, regardless of the Nation they belong to.

All Army units inside a single region and controlled by
the same player are considered a single group and are
collectively called an Army.

An Army can be composed of a maximum of ten units, or
five units if the Army is inside a Stronghold under siege.

Free Peoples Leaders
The captains and chieftains leading the Armies of the Free
Peoples are represented by Leader figures.

Leaders are unable to move on their own and must always
be part of a friendly Army. If at any time a Leader is on the
map without an Army, he is immediately removed.

The presence of a Leader in an Army provides an advantage
in combat and a superior movement capability. There is
no limit to the number of Leaders who can be in the same
Army. Free Peoples Leaders, regardless of nationality, can lead
Armies composed of units from any Free Peoples Nation.

A Leader is not considered an Army unit and cannot be
taken as a casualty, nor does the presence of a Leader add to
the Combat Strength of an Army (see page 28).

Nazgûl
The Nazgûl, also called Ringwraiths, act as Leaders for the
Shadow Armies and each is represented by the distinctive
Ringwraith figure mounted on a winged beast.

The rules pertaining to the Free Peoples Leaders also apply
to the Nazgûl, with the following exceptions:

—

The Nazgûl are not obliged to be part of a friendly
Army and can move on their own, flying to any
region (even regions containing Free Peoples units)
on the game board with a single movement.

Exception: a Nazgûl moving without an Army cannot be
placed alone in an enemy-controlled Stronghold.

—

The Nazgûl are unaffected by the presence of an
enemy Army in the same region.

Characters
The main heroes of the story and their main antagonists are
represented by the Character figures.

Characters are personalities with abilities superior to
those of simple Leaders. Characters belonging to the Free
Peoples are called Companions, while the Characters of
the Shadow are called Minions.

Each Character is represented by a unique figure and a
Character card detailing his special skills. Players should
carefully read all of the Character cards before playing the
game.

In game terms, Characters act much the same as Leaders,
but they do not suffer the same restrictions and can move
on the game board on their own, ignoring the presence of
enemy Armies.

Companions: Legolas, Gimli, Boromir, Aragorn (as
Strider), Meriadoc, Peregrin, and Gandalf the Grey start
the game as the Companions of Frodo and Sam (the Ring-
bearers) and members of the Fellowship of the Ring. As
the game progresses, they can leave the Fellowship to help
rouse the Free Peoples Nations to war and to act as Leaders
for the Free Peoples Armies.

Under certain conditions (as described on their Character
cards), Strider and Gandalf the Grey can be replaced by
their more powerful incarnations: Aragorn – Heir to
Isildur and Gandalf the White.

Aragorn – Heir to
Isildur Marker

Gandalf the White
Marker

When this happens, put the appropriate marker under the
plastic figure of the Character to remember his new status.

Minions: The more prominent servants of the Dark Lord—
Saruman, the Witch-king, and the Mouth of Sauron—do
not start in play at the beginning of the game. They will
enter play later, under the conditions specified on their
Character cards.

Gollum: Gollum is a very unusual Character. Gollum is
always assumed to be following the Fellowship of the Ring,
and he becomes the Guide of the Fellowship if the Ring-
bearers are alone. When this happens, you may place the
Gollum figure together with the Ring-bearers figure as a
reminder of his presence. The effects of Gollum’s actions
are represented in the game by the Gollum Character card
and certain Event cards.

THE GAME BOARD
The game board is a view of western Middle-earth at
the end of the Third Age. In addition to the playing
area proper, the game board also includes several spaces
and tracks used to help the players keep track of various
elements and components of the game.

The diagram of the game board (see pages 12-13) identifies
its various parts and shows the spaces where many of the
components needed at the start of the game are placed
during setup.

A white line is the normal
border between two
regions.

A river between two white
lines is also a common style
of border between two
regions, which acts as a
normal border.

A thick black line represents
a mountain border, which
can never be crossed.

A colored line running
along a border shows the
border of a Nation.

When two Nations are
neighbors, two colored
lines run along each other,
separated by the white
border.

Sea areas are not regions
and can never be crossed.
Regions bordering the large
sea area on the left side of
the board are called coastal
regions.

Larger letters in the name
of a region show that the
region includes a City or
Stronghold.

REGIONS
The main portion of the game board shows a view of
western Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age. The
map is divided into territories called regions. Each region
is identified by a name, which usually refers to a site of
note or to an entire geographical area (such as Minas Tirith
or Cardolan). Regions are used to regulate movement,
combat, and the placement of all plastic figures.

Regions are normally separated by a white line or by a river
between two white lines.

A thick black border denotes impassable terrain which
cannot be crossed, usually a high mountain range. If the
border between two regions is completely divided by such
a line, those regions are not considered adjacent for any
purpose.

Some areas of the board are completely blue, either
surrounded by a black line or bordered by a white line.
These areas are seas or lakes. A sea or lake area is not a
region and can never be crossed or moved into.

Free Regions
The rules and Event cards often refer to a free region. A
region is free for a player when it doesn’t contain an enemy
Army and/or an enemy-controlled Settlement. A region
containing a Stronghold controlled by the enemy is also
free for a player when the Stronghold is besieged by an
Army of that player.

NATIONS
Several regions are grouped and identified as Nations
by their colored borders (see diagram on page 9). Some
Nations consist of several separate groups of regions,
divided and distant from one another.

FORTIFICATIONS AND SETTLEMENTS
A region can be empty, or contain either a Fortification
or one of three types of Settlements (Town, City, or
Stronghold).

Fortifications
A Fortification in a region offers easily defendable positions,
such as a ruin, a fort, or a ford crossing a river. There are
two Fortifications on the map: in the regions of Osgiliath
and the Fords of Isen.

Fortification

10 • War of the Ring — Second Edition

Chapter II: Game Components • 11

Settlements
Settlements represent locations that are vital to the
economy and defense of a Nation. A region containing a
Settlement gives several advantages to the player controlling
it.

The   symbol appearing on a City is a reminder that control
of this region is worth 1 Victory point to the opponent.
The     symbol appearing on a Stronghold is a reminder that
control of this Stronghold is worth 2 Victory points to the
opponent.

Towns represent populated areas that allow the recruitment
of troops of a specific Nation. The presence of a Town
is shown on the board by the symbol of the appropriate
Nation.

Unconquered
Event cards may refer to an unconquered Settlement. A
Settlement is unconquered if it is controlled by the same
player who controlled it at the beginning of the game. A
Settlement which was captured by the opponent, and then
recaptured by its original owner, is “unconquered” once
again. A Stronghold under siege is considered unconquered
if the besieged Army belongs to the original owner.

Free Peoples Town

Shadow Town

Cities represent major urban centers and can also be used
to recruit troops. They also provide an advantage in combat
to defending troops.

TRACKS AND BOXES
In addition to the regions of Middle-earth, the game board
also contains various boxes and tracks used during the game
to keep track of different activities. These areas include:

Free Peoples City

Shadow City

Strongholds represent fortresses, Elven homes, and the
greatest capitals of Middle-earth. Troops may be recruited
in Strongholds, and defenders receive a very strong
advantage in battle.

Note: Each Stronghold on the board is
matched by a Stronghold Box with the same
drawing (or with a generic drawing in the case
of Shadow Strongholds).

Free Peoples Stronghold

Shadow Stronghold

The Cities and Strongholds of Middle-earth give Victory
points to a player who captures them from the enemy (see
page 32).

In both Cities and Strongholds, the color of the frame
shows which player initially controls it (red for the Shadow,
blue for the Free Peoples). The icon in the upper corner
shows which Nation the City or Stronghold belongs to.

B efore you start playing, you should decide who will

play the Free Peoples and who will play the Shadow.

Then, get the game ready to play by following these

steps.

STEP 1
Place the game board on a suitable surface, possibly large
enough to leave some room along the sides of the board
(to place discarded cards and eliminated pieces and to roll
dice).

STEP 2
Place the Ring-bearers figure on Rivendell, its starting
point.

STEP 3
Place the Fellowship Progress counter on Step 0 of
the Fellowship Track, with the “Hidden” side up. The
Corruption counter is also placed on Step 0 of the same
track.

STEP 4
Place all Companion cards in the Guide of the Fellowship
Box, with the Gandalf the Grey Character card on top,
as he is the starting Guide of the Fellowship. Set aside the
cards for Aragorn – Heir to Isildur, Gandalf the White,
and Gollum for later use.

STEP 7
Set aside all Shadow Minion cards (the Witch-king,
Saruman, and the Mouth of Sauron) and the corresponding
figures for later use.

STEP 8
Separate the Free Peoples and Shadow Event cards into
Character and Strategy decks according to the back of
each card, shuffle them separately, and place them on the
corresponding areas of the game board.

STEP 9
Put the standard Hunt tiles (beige) in a cup or other
opaque container: this is the Hunt Pool. Set aside the
special Hunt tiles (blue and red) for later use.

STEP 10
Give seven red Shadow Action dice to the Shadow player
and four blue Free Peoples Action dice to the Free Peoples
player. Set aside the remaining Action dice for later use. Set
aside the five Combat dice.

STEP 11
Place the Political counter for each Free Peoples Nation
on its starting point on the Political Track. All of the Free
Peoples Nations’ Political counters except for that of the
Elves are placed with the “Passive” side up. The Political
counters of the Elves and all the Shadow Army Nations
are placed with the “Active” side up. As indicated by the
symbols on the track, place the Rohan, the North, the
Elven, and the Dwarven Nations’ Political counters in
the top box, place the Gondor and Southron/Easterling
Political counters in the second box from the top, and
finally place the Sauron and Isengard Political counters in
the third box from the top—immediately above the “At
War” box.

STEP 5
Place all the Companion figures and their counters in the
The Fellowship of the Ring Box. Set aside the Gollum
figure for later use.

STEP 6
Place the three Elven Ring counters in the Free Peoples’
Elven Rings Box of the game board with the “Ring” side
up.

STEP 12
Sort all the plastic figures by their color and their type and
follow the Army Setup diagram on pages 16-17 to place
each Nation’s initial Army units and Leaders. Set aside any
remaining figures to use as reinforcements, paying attention
not to mix them with pieces eliminated from play as the
game progresses. Set aside the Army counters for use later
in the game.

Keep all the remaining components in the box; they will be
used later in the game.

The results of the rolled Action dice dictate the actions
the players can take during this phase. Starting with the
Free Peoples player, the two players alternate actions, each
taking one action by selecting and removing one of his
available die results. (See also Using Action Dice, page 19.)

War of the Ring is played over a series of turns, until

either player wins the game. Each turn is divided
into six phases.

Each time the Free Peoples player uses an Action die to
move the Fellowship, he places that die in the Hunt Box
after completing the action. All other used dice are set aside
until next turn.

SUMMARY OF THE TURN
The phases of the turn are:

Phase 1) Recover Action Dice and Draw Event Cards
Each player recovers the Action dice he used in the previous
turn, plus any dice which were added to the Action Dice
Pool and minus any dice which were removed from the
pool.

Then, each player draws 2 cards, one from each of their
respective Event decks.

Phase 2) Fellowship Phase
The Free Peoples player may now declare the position of
the Fellowship.

If the Fellowship is declared in a City or Stronghold of a
Free Peoples Nation, that Nation is activated (if the Nation
is showing “Passive” on the Political Track, flip the Nation
to “Active”) and the Ring-bearers may be healed.

Also, during this phase, the Free Peoples player may change
the Guide of the Fellowship.

Phase 3) Hunt Allocation
The Shadow player may now place a number of Action dice
in the Hunt Box located on the game board. The Shadow
player must place at least one Action die if the Free Peoples
player retrieved at least 1 die from the Hunt Box during
Phase 1. He may allocate only as many dice as the number
of Companions remaining in the Fellowship. These dice are
not rolled during the following Action Roll phase.

Phase 4) Action Roll
Players roll their Action dice (except the dice already in the
Hunt Box). Then, the Shadow player immediately takes all
the rolled dice showing the “Eye” result and adds them to
the Hunt Box.

Phase 5) Action Resolution
This phase is the primary game phase of the War of the
Ring board game.

It is during this phase that players will utilize the Action
dice results to move their Characters and Armies on the
game board, or to take other important actions.

The use of each different Action die is described in more
detail later.

Phase 6) Victory Check
Players now check to see whether either player has achieved
the Military Victory conditions. If not, a new game turn
begins.

Note: If a Ring-based Victory condition (see
page 44) occurs at any time during a turn, the
game ends immediately, without waiting for
the Victory Check phase.

THE ACTION DICE
The Action dice play a fundamental role in the game, as they
dictate the options available to each player during a turn.

These dice have special icons on their faces, each icon
representing a different group of action from which the
players may choose. The different numbers and types
of icons appearing on the Free Peoples Action dice and
Shadow Action dice reflect the different attitudes of the two
sides fighting the War of the Ring.

The Action Dice Icons table, on the facing page, shows the
meaning of these icons.

Note: The Free Peoples Action dice have two
faces which show the “Character” action, and
that on these dice the “Army” action only appears
on a face combined with the “Muster” action.

ACTION DICE POOL
The total number of Action dice rolled by a player in a turn
is called his dice pool.

The Shadow player starts the game with seven dice in his
pool, but may gain additional dice later in the game, up to
a maximum of ten. These additional Action dice enter play
when the Shadow player brings his Minions into the game
(one die for Saruman, one for the Witch-king, one for the
Mouth of Sauron).

* Note: the Free Peoples Action dice have two faces which show the Character action.
On these dice, the “Army” action only appears on a face combined with the Muster action.

The Free Peoples player starts with four dice in his pool.
Like the Shadow, he can also gain additional dice later in
the game. The Free Peoples player adds one die to his dice
pool when Aragorn – Heir to Isildur enters play and
another one when Gandalf the White appears.

Both the Shadow and the Free Peoples player lose the
additional die if the corresponding Character is eliminated.

When a player gains or loses an Action die, the gain or loss
becomes effective in the next turn: the die is added to, or
removed from, the dice pool during the Recover Action
Dice and Draw Event Cards phase of the following turn.

HUNT ALLOCATION AND ACTION ROLL
The Shadow player, during the Hunt Allocation phase,
places the number of Action dice into the Hunt Box that he
wants to devote to the Hunt for the Ring.

The dice placed in the Hunt Box are not rolled, but the
Shadow player rolls the remaining dice in his dice pool, and
all dice showing an “Eye” result are immediately added to
the Hunt Box as well.

The Free Peoples player simply rolls his entire Action dice
pool.

USING ACTION DICE
Starting with the Free Peoples, players alternate actions
selecting one of their Action dice and immediately taking
the action made available by the specific die result.

Each Action die is printed with a set of distinctive icons,
corresponding to different game actions. Each action is
detailed later in the rules and summarized in the Action
Dice Reference Chart (see page 20; the chart is also
included in the Player Aids).

If one or more Fellowship Action dice were in the Hunt
Box at the end of the previous turn, he must place a
minimum of 1 die in the Hunt Box.

When an action has been completed, the corresponding die
is considered “used” and is set aside until needed again for
the next turn.

The maximum number of dice he can place in the Hunt
Box is equal to the number of Companions currently
in the Fellowship (note that the Ring-bearers are not
considered to be a Companion and do not add to this
maximum).

However, the Shadow player may always place at least one
die in the Hunt Box, even if all the Companions have left
the Fellowship.

The only exception to this rule is that each time the Free
Peoples player uses an Action die to move the Fellowship, he
places that die in the Hunt Box after completing the action
rather than setting it aside (note that the die is returned to
the Free Peoples player during the Recover Action Dice and
Draw Event Cards phase of the next turn).

If a player has fewer unused Action dice than his opponent
(typically the Free Peoples player will have fewer Action dice
than the Shadow player), he can pass instead of taking an
action, thus allowing the opponent to take another action.

This die result can be used to execute one of the
following actions:

—  Draw an Event card. Draw one Event card from

an Event deck of your choice.

—

Play an Event card. Play any one Event card
from your hand, regardless of its type.

MUSTER/ARMY

Choose any one action from those listed under Muster

SPECIAL

These die results are different on the Shadow dice and
on the Free Peoples dice:

EYE OF SAURON

A player may also choose to skip an action and discard one
of his Action dice without effect, instead of using that die
to take an action.

If a player runs out of actions before his opponent has done
the same, the opponent executes his remaining actions one
after the other.

THE ELVEN RINGS
At the beginning of the game, the Free Peoples player
receives three counters, representing the Elven Rings of
Power. He keeps each counter in the Elven Rings Box on the
game board, with the Ring side face up, until he decides to
use it.

When the Free Peoples player uses an Elven Ring, he flips
over the counter to show its “Flaming Eye” side and gives
it to the Shadow player. After the Shadow player uses the
counter, it is discarded from play.

Each Elven Ring/Eye counter can thus be used once by its
owner in the following way:

When a player is eligible to take an action during the
Action Resolution phase, he may use an Elven Ring to
change the result shown on one of his unused Action
dice to another Action die result of his choice.

A player that just used an Elven Ring to change a die result
then proceeds to take a regular action, choosing any one
Action die result (not necessarily the one he has just changed
with the Elven Ring). He can also skip or pass the action, if
eligible to do so.

All dice showing the Eye must be placed in the Hunt
Box.

The use of an Elven Ring is subject to the following
limitations:

WILL OF THE WEST

—

—

Before taking an action, the Free Peoples player
may change a Will of the West result into any
other Action die result, and use it to the same
effect as the chosen result.

The Will of the West result can also be used to
bring into play Gandalf the White or Aragorn
– Heir to Isildur according to the rules on their
Character cards.

—  Only one Elven Ring may be used by the same player

during the course of a single turn.

—

—

The Free Peoples player may not use an Elven Ring to
change an Action die to a “Will of the West” result.

The Shadow player can use an Elven Ring to change a
die result into an “Eye” result (that die is immediately
moved to the Hunt Box). This does not count as
an action, so he may then take an action normally.
However, he cannot do the opposite and use an Elven
Ring to change the result of an Action die already
showing an “Eye” result.

T he Event cards represent many of the fortunate (or

unfortunate) episodes in The Lord of the Rings, as
well as special items, unexpected occurrences, and

“what if”s. Moreover, each Event card can alternatively be
used for a special combat effect to be employed in battle.
When an Event card is used for its combat ability, we refer
to the card as a Combat card.

EVENT DECKS
Each player receives two decks of Event cards: his Strategy
deck (represented graphically by an army banner) and his
Character deck (represented graphically by a sword).

Cards in the Strategy deck usually offer military and
political options to the player. Cards in the Character deck
are often related to the Fellowship and to the actions of
Companions and Minions on the map.

Example: For the Free Peoples player to play the
Strategy Card “Paths of the Woses” he must either
use an Action dice that shows the Palantir symbol
(the Event result), or an Action dice that shows the
Banner symbol (the Army result).

Generally, Event cards are discarded as soon as their effects
are resolved.

The effects of an Event card are explained in its text.

Often, some kind of requirement must be met for the
effects of the card to apply; if a requirement is not fully
satisfied, the card cannot be played.

Usually, a card allows a player to take an action that violates
the standard rules; this is intentional, but any rule that is
not expressly replaced by the card text still applies normally.

Some exceptions to the general rules use the following
terminology:

—

If a card reads “Play on the table,” it means that the
card is not discarded after it is played, and its effects
last until a particular condition or requirement is
met after which the card is discarded. If discarding a
card requires the use of an Action die, discarding the
card counts as an action. Note that if the condition
required to play such a card ceases to be met, the
card is immediately discarded.

DRAWING EVENT CARDS
During the first phase of each game turn (including the
first turn) both players must draw one card from each of
their decks.

—

It is also possible for players to draw cards from either deck
by using an Action die result during the Action Resolution
phase (see page 21).

Players may hold a maximum of six cards in their hand
at any time and must immediately discard those in excess
as soon as the maximum number is exceeded. Cards are
discarded face down.

If a deck is depleted during the game, the discarded cards
are not reshuffled. It is now no longer possible for the
player to draw cards out of that deck (and thus he may only
draw one card from the other deck during the Recover
Action dice and Draw Event Cards phase).

PLAYING EVENT CARDS
Event cards can be played during the Action Resolution
phase in two ways:

1)

2)

by using an Event Action die result (the Palantir
symbol), or

by using an Action die result whose icon matches the
symbol on the upper right corner of the card.

Example: “Denethor’s Folly” is discarded if Minas
Tirith is no longer under siege.

If a card text directs you to “recruit” units or
Leaders, these units or Leaders are taken from your
available reinforcements. See also Using an Event
Card to Recruit Troops, on page 27, for the specific
workings of Event cards who allow recruitments.

The actions indicated by an Event card are mandatory.
However, it can happen that the effects of an Event card
cannot be fully applied. In this case, the card can still be
played, and its effects are applied to the maximum extent
possible.

Example: The “Imrahil of Dol Amroth” card
allows the Free Peoples player to recruit one Leader
and one Elite (or Regular) unit in Dol Amroth.
If no Leader is available in the Free Peoples
reinforcements, only the Elite or Regular unit is
recruited.

Event Cards Provoking Casualties
Several cards describe effects that may cause a player to
remove some figures from play. If all the Army units in an
Army are eliminated by the effect of such a card, all Free
Peoples Leaders with the Army are immediately removed,
while any Nazgûl, Companions, or Minions are left in the
region, unless specified differently in the card text.

Chapter V: The Event Cards • 23

COMBAT CARDS
In addition to their standard Event text, all Event cards
contain additional text (located at the bottom of the cards)
representing their use as Combat cards.

Unlike playing an Event card for its main use, playing it as a
Combat card does not require taking an action. Combat
cards are played during a battle, See Resolving a Battle, on
page 29, for further details.

Just like with Event card effects, Combat card effects
modify the normal rules of the game, and the text of
the card always has precedence over the normal rules.
Event cards used as Combat cards are always discarded
immediately after use.

T he vast hordes of the Dark Lord and the stout

defenders of the West play a central role in War of
the Ring, and their mustering and employment is

crucial. From their initial starting positions (as described in
Setting up the Game), the Armies of both players will swell
with reinforcements and move to battle according to the
following rules.

CHARACTERS

PLAYING FREE PEOPLES CHARACTERS
Free Peoples Characters (Companions) are brought into
play in two ways:

—

Companions enter play when they are separated from
the Fellowship (see Separating Companions from the
Fellowship, page 39);

—  Gandalf the White and Aragorn – Heir to Isildur,

are brought into play using a Will of the West die.
Use the rules specified by their Character card.

PLAYING SHADOW CHARACTERS
Shadow Characters (Minions) are brought into play using
a Muster die. This use of a Muster die does not follow the
normal rules for recruitment — use the rules specified by
the Character card.

MOVING CHARACTERS
Characters are moved on the game board during the
Action Resolution phase by using a Character Action
die result (the Sword icon), or by playing an Event card
that allows the movement of Characters.

A Character Action die result can be used:

—

—

To move all Companions who are not in the
Fellowship (Free Peoples player only).

To move all Nazgûl and Minions (Shadow player
only).

Note: If a Character’s Level is 0, he cannot
move, even when attached to an Army.

Moving Companions
When the Free Peoples player uses a Character Action die
result to move his Characters, all Companions on the map
may be moved a number of regions equal to or less than
their Level (see later).

However, a group of Companions in the same region can
be moved to a common destination at a distance equal to or
less than the highest Level in the group.

The Free Peoples player can create more than one group
from the Companions in the same region, which may then
move independently to different destinations.

When Companions move, they are subject to the following
rules:

—

—

They are unaffected by any enemy Army. When
moving alone or with other Companions, they can
enter or leave a region that contains Shadow units,
but must stop upon entering a region containing a
Stronghold controlled by the Shadow player.

They can never leave or enter a region containing
a friendly Stronghold besieged by an enemy Army
(except as a result of certain Event card effects).

—

They cannot cross impassable terrain (black borders).

Moving Nazgûl and Minions
When the Shadow player uses a Character Action die result
to move his Characters, each Nazgûl (including the Witch-
king) can be moved to any region on the game board with
a single move. One, some, or all Nazgûl can be moved this
way using a single Character Action die result.

The only restriction is that the Nazgûl can never move this
way into a region that contains a Stronghold controlled by
the Free Peoples player, unless that Stronghold is besieged
by a Shadow Army.

Note that in War of the Ring, for the purposes of rules
clarity, the Witch-king is considered to be a Nazgûl
(including with respect to all references to “Nazgûl” on
Event cards, unless differentiated in the card text by the use
of his name or the “Minion” title).

The Mouth of Sauron and Saruman do not possess the
unlimited movement ability of the Nazgûl; they are subject
to the following rules:

—

—

Saruman can never leave the Orthanc region.

The Mouth of Sauron can move up to three regions
if moving alone. Like Companions, he cannot cross
impassable terrain, he ignores any enemy Army when
moving alone and cannot leave or enter a region that
contains a friendly Stronghold besieged by an enemy
Army.

Like the Nazgûl, any Minion moving without an Army cannot
be moved into a region containing a Stronghold controlled by
the Free Peoples unless it is besieged by a Shadow Army.

ARMIES AND STACKING

RECRUITING TROOPS

ARMY COMPOSITION
All friendly Army units, Leaders and Characters inside a
single region form an Army.

An Army can be composed of units belonging to different
Nations fighting on the same side.

If a moving Army enters a region occupied by another
friendly Army, the two Armies are merged into a single
Army at the end of the action.

Likewise, an Army can be splitted by simply moving part of
its units into an adjacent region and leaving the rest behind.

RECRUITING NEW UNITS AND LEADERS
Additional Army units and Leaders are brought into
the game during the Action Resolution phase by using
a Muster Action die result (a Helmet icon) as an action,
or by playing an Event card that recruits new units.

To bring reinforcements onto the board when using a
Muster Action die result, the new figures must belong to a
Nation “At War” (see later).

Using a single Muster Action die result, a player can bring
the following figures into play:

STACKING LIMIT
A single region can contain a maximum of 10 Army units.

If, at the end of any action (for example, after moving or
mustering troops), more than 10 units are in the same
region, the excess units must be removed from the game by
the controlling player.

Units removed in this way can re-enter the game later as
reinforcements.

ARMY BOXES
Along the left side of the board can be found three
numbered Army Boxes.

If the size and number of plastic figures happen to be
troublesome to physically fit in a single region, the
controlling player may move some or all his figures from
a region to a free Army Box, placing the corresponding
numbered Army counter in the region for identification
purposes. Figures can be moved back to the board from the
Army Box at any time.

Players must be careful not to exceed the stacking limit
when making use of an Army Box. For all game purposes,
the figures in the box are considered to be in the region
containing the Army counter.

Example: The Free Peoples player moves an Army
composed of 10 Gondor regular units in Lossarnach,
and finds out that they take up too much space.
Army Box number 3 is free, so the player removes
8 of the Gondor regular figures and places them
in the Army Box. He then places the Army counter
number 3 in Lossarnach with the remaining two
figures. Whenever it becomes necessary, the counter
may be replaced by the figures in the box.

—

—

—

—

two Regular units, or

two Leaders/Nazgûl, or

one Regular unit and one Leader/Nazgûl, or

one Elite unit.

All newly recruited figures are taken from the player’s
available reinforcements and can only be placed in a free City,
Town, or Stronghold of the Nation to which they belong.

When two regular units or Leaders, or a combination of
the two, are brought into play using a Muster Action die
result, they can belong to different Nations, as long as
both Nations concerned are “At War” (see page 35) and
each figure is placed in a City, Town, or Stronghold of the
Nation to which the unit belongs.

Nazgûl are always recruited in the Strongholds of the
Sauron Nation.

RECRUITING RESTRICTIONS
—  When mustering two figures (units and/or Leaders)

using a Muster Action die result, the two figures
must always be placed in separate Settlements.

—

—

—

You cannot muster or recruit troops in a Settlement
controlled by the enemy.

You cannot muster troops in a Stronghold besieged
(see pages 31-32) by the enemy.

Reinforcements are limited to the available figures.
Thus, if all figures of a type are in play, no additional
figures of that type can be recruited. Shadow units
and Nazgûl removed as casualties are placed back
among the available reinforcements (thus allowing
for an almost limitless mustering). All Characters
(including Shadow Minions), Free Peoples units and
Free Peoples Leaders, are permanently out of the
game if eliminated; they should be placed in an area
designated for casualties (such as back in the box)
and are no longer eligible for recruitment.

26 • War of the Ring — Second Edition

Chapter VI: Armies and Battles • 27

USING AN EVENT CARD TO RECRUIT
TROOPS
When a player uses Event cards whose effects is to recruit
troops in a certain region (or regions), he is allowed to
recruit in that region even if:

—

the troops belong to a Nation which hasn’t reached
the “At War” step yet;

—

the region includes a Stronghold under siege.

Other restrictions still apply, including:

—
—

the figures must be available to be recruited;
the recruitment cannot be made if the region is not
free (with the notable exception of a Stronghold
under siege previously indicated).

Example: The “Riders of Théoden” Event card
lets a player recruit troops in a Rohan region
containing a Companion. If there is a Companion
in Eastemnet, but that region also contains enemy
troops, it is not possible to recruit there. However,
if the Companion is with a Free Peoples Army
besieged in Helm's Deep, recruitment is possible.

ARMY MOVEMENT

MOVING AN ARMY
Armies are moved on the game board during the Action
Resolution phase by using either an Army Action die
result or a Character Action die result (if the moving
Army contains a Leader or Character), or an Event card
that allows the movement of Armies.

A player using an Army Action die result can move two
different Armies, but can not move the same Army twice.

A player using a Character Action die result can move a
single Army containing at least one Leader or Character.

An Army is moved by simply moving its units to an
adjacent region.

Splitting an Army
It is not mandatory that you move all units in an Army. An
Army can split itself into two different Armies by moving
only a portion of its units to an adjacent region.

Free Peoples Leaders can never be in a region without
combat units, so if a moving Army completely vacates
a region, all such Leaders must follow the Army. If the
Army splits, Leaders may choose to either move or stay
behind. When a player uses a Character Action die result to
move an Army and the Army splits, at least one Leader or
Character must join the moving units.

Note that, unless used as the subject to move an Army with
a Character Action die result, Characters (Companions
and Minions) and Nazgûl are not obliged to move with an
Army, as they can remain in a region on their own.

Movement Restrictions
—

The moving units, as well as Leaders and Characters,
can be chosen freely, as long as no figure is moved
twice using the same action (this includes movement
effectuated by Event cards, unless the card explicitly
has different instructions). Thus, during the same
action, it is never possible to move an Army into a
region containing another friendly Army (joining
the two Armies into one), and then move the
new combined Army with the second movement
allowance, as this would move the units in the first
Army twice. For purposes of moving under one
action, these Armies should be kept separate until
both movements have been taken.
Note: An Army can move multiple times in a single
turn, as long as it uses a different Action die for each
movement.

—

—

—

—

—

Any region entered by a moving Army must be
either a free region (see Free Regions, on page 10) or
an enemy-controlled Settlement that is free of enemy
Army units. These are known as “regions that are
free for the purposes of Army movement.”

If a region is occupied by enemy units, it cannot be
entered but must be attacked (see page 28).

After moving an Army into a region, you can not
exceed the stacking limit of 10 units.

If a moving Army includes any units from a Nation
which is not yet “At War” on the Political Track (see
page 35), it cannot enter a region that is inside the
borders of another Nation (even if friendly).

An Army can never move into a region that is
completely separated from the region the Army is
currently in by a black line (which denotes impassable
terrain). The same restriction applies to Characters
(see page 24) and to the Fellowship (see page 38).

USING AN EVENT CARD TO MOVE ARMIES
When using Event cards whose effects allow a player to
move Armies, all regular movement restrictions must be
respected. Some Event cards allow a player to move one
or more Armies through more than one region, and the
following additional rules apply:

—

Each Army to be moved is defined at the beginning
of its movement (it is possible to split the Army
before moving). The Army cannot pick up or drop
figures along the way.

28 • War of the Ring — Second Edition

Note that, unlike when used merely for movement, an
Army Action die result can only activate a single Army for
the purpose of attacking.

An Army using a Character Action die result to make an
attack must contain at least one Leader or Character.

Note: When a battle is initiated, attacking
units do not actually move into the region they
are attacking, but instead stay in their present
region for the duration of the attack. Only if
the battle is over and won, the attacker may
move his attacking units into the embattled
region (see End of Battle, page 31).

Splitting an Attacking Army
It is not mandatory for all figures composing an Army
chosen to attack to participate in the battle.

When a player is about to attack, he can split the Army
into two, dividing the figures contained in the region into
an attacking Army and into a second Army, called the
rearguard, that will not take part in the upcoming battle.

Each of the two newly-created Armies must contain at least
one Army unit, while Leaders, Companions, or Minions can
be distributed among the two Armies as the player sees fit.

Note: If the player is using a Character
Action die result to attack, the newly-created
attacking Army must contain at least one
Leader or one Character.

The Army chosen as the rearguard does not affect the battle
in any way, it cannot be targeted by Combat card effects, its
figures cannot be chosen as casualties, and it cannot advance
into the contested region if the battle is won.

If the attacking Army includes one or more figures belonging
to Nations not “At War,” then it is mandatory to split the
Army (leaving with the rearguard any figure which is not “At
War”).

Note that all defending figures (units, Leaders and
Characters) are always considered to be part of the battle.

Combat Strength and Leadership
Attacking and defending Army units, Leaders, and
Characters all participate in determining the Combat
Strength and Leadership of the Armies involved in battle.

—

The Combat Strength of an Army is equal to the
total number of its Army units (Regular and Elite
units). Combat Strength determines the number of
dice rolled in the Combat roll, up to a maximum of
five dice. This means that units in excess of five do
not add to the number of dice rolled by an Army,
but an Army with more than five units is usually
able to retain its full Combat Strength for a longer
period—see Remove Casualties, on page 30.

—

—

If an Army moves through an enemy-controlled
Settlement, it captures that Settlement.

If an Army moves through regions containing other
friendly Armies, stacking limits are checked only after
all the multiple movements have been completed.

BATTLE RESOLUTION

ATTACKING WITH ARMIES
An Army is allowed to attack an enemy Army during
the Action Resolution phase by using an Army or a
Character Action die result, or by playing an Event card
that allows an Army to attack.

Only Armies belonging to a Nation “At War” on the
Political Track can start a battle.

A player can use an Army Action die result, or a Character
Action die result (if the Army contains at least one Leader
or Character), for the following purposes:

—

—

To attack an enemy Army in an adjacent region.

To initiate a siege or a sortie against an enemy Army
in the same region (see page 32).

28 • War of the Ring — Second Edition

Chapter VI: Armies and Battles • 29

Example: An Army containing three Regular
units and one Elite unit has a Combat Strength of
4. Alternately, an Army of six Regular units and
two Elite units has a Combat Strength of 8, but will
still only roll the maximum of five dice.

—

The Leadership of an Army is equal to the number
of Leaders (or Nazgûl), plus the Leadership
ratings of all participating Characters (as shown on
each Character card). Leadership determines the
maximum number of dice that may be rolled in the
Leader re-roll, up to a maximum of five dice.

Often, Combat cards and Character special abilities modify
the Combat Strength and Leadership rating of an Army
involved in battle. In either case, the maximum of five dice
can never be exceeded, regardless of modifiers.

RESOLVING A BATTLE
A battle is resolved in a series of Combat rounds. During
each round, both players follow the steps below:

1)

2)

3)

4)

5)

Play a Combat card (optional).

Roll the dice for the Combat roll.

Roll the dice for the Leader re-roll.

Remove casualties.

Choose to Cease the attack or Retreat.

Each step is resolved simultaneously by the players (both
perform step 1, both perform step 2, etc.).

Play a Combat Card
At the beginning of each Combat round, each player
may play one Event card from his hand as a Combat
card.

First, the attacker declares whether he wants to use a
Combat card and chooses the card.

Then, the defender declares if he wants to use a Combat
card and chooses the card. The defender may play a
Combat card even if the attacker chooses not to.

Cards are chosen secretly, then revealed simultaneously.
However, the back of the chosen card is always visible to
the opponent.

It is important that each player carefully reads the text on
his Combat card before choosing it, especially with respect
to its requirements, modifiers, and application.

Unless otherwise specified, the effects of a card only apply
for the current Combat round.

Combat cards are always discarded as soon as the Combat
round is over.

Timing of Combat Cards
The text of a Combat card should establish with reasonable
clarity when the effects of a card should be applied during
the battle.

In the case of any uncertainty as to timing, the initiative
number in the bottom left corner of the card indicates
which card must be applied first: the card with the lower
number is applied first.

Example: The Shadow player is the attacker and
plays “Durin’s Bane,” which allows him to roll
a special attack before the normal combat begins
(Initiative: 2). The Free Peoples player has played
“Scouts,” however, which allows him to retreat his
Army before normal Combat begins (Initiative: 1).
Since “Scouts” has a smaller number, it is resolved
first and the Free Peoples Army retreats before the
special attack of “Durin’s Bane” is possible. Both
cards are then discarded.

If the two cards have the same initiative, the effects of the
defender’s card are always applied first.

Note that if a Combat card has more than one effect (for
example, the “Mûmakil” card), it has one initiative number
for each effect with a different timing.

Requirements of Combat Cards
—

Some Combat cards have specific requirements
(indicated in boldface under the Combat title) that
must be met for the card to be played. For example,
some cards can be played only if friendly Elite units
are involved in the battle.

—  Many cards require a player to forfeit Leadership,

which means that the selected figure (or figures)
whose Leadership is forfeited does not count as
a Leader (for the purpose of determining the
Leadership rating) for that Combat round. You
may not forfeit the Leadership of a figure, if that
Leadership has been canceled for any reason.

Attack Rolls of Combat Cards
Some Combat cards allow an additional attack to be made,
either before the Combat roll (step 2) or after the removal
of casualties (step 4). Unless otherwise specified, these
attacks use the same base hit number as the Combat roll.
They are carried out in the same manner as the Combat roll
(see below), with three exceptions:

—

—

—

A Leader re-roll is never applicable.

Any modifier to the Combat roll granted by the
opposing player’s Combat card does not apply.

Any casualties are removed immediately, and they
are not influenced by any effect of the opponent’s
Combat card.

30 • War of the Ring — Second Edition

Roll the Dice for the Combat Roll
During this step, each player rolls a number of Combat
dice equal to the Combat Strength of their respective
Armies (up to a maximum of five dice).

Each die rolled scores a hit on a result of ‘5’ or  ‘6.’
The effects of Combat cards, Strongholds, Cities, and
Fortifications, however, may raise or lower the target
number required to hit.

Roll the Dice for the Leader Re–roll
After the Combat roll, both players can re–roll a
number of failed die rolls equal to their Leadership (up
to a maximum of five dice).

The result required to score a hit on the Leader re–roll
remains the same as the result required for the Combat roll
(unless modified by a specific Combat card effect).

Example: A player has five Army units and three
Leaders in a battle. His Combat Strength is thus
5 and his Leadership is 3. He rolls five dice as a
Combat roll, getting ‘1,’ ‘3,’ ‘5,’ ‘5,’ ‘6’ (three hits).
His Leadership is 3, but only two dice failed to hit, so
he picks them up and rolls those two dice again. This
time one die hits, for a grand total of four hits.

Modifiers to Rolls
Combat rolls and Leader re–rolls can be modified by cards
or special abilities. Modifiers to rolls are indicated by “add
one,” “add two,” and so on. The modifier is added to the
result of each rolled die, and then the modified result is
compared to the number needed to hit. Multiple modifiers
are cumulative, so they must be added together to get the
total modifier.

Example: If you add one to the dice in the Combat
roll, the roll will score a hit on the result of a ‘4,’ ‘5,’
or ‘6’ rather than only ‘5’ or  ‘6.’

Usually, Combat card effects will instruct a player to modify
only the Combat roll, or the Leader re–roll, or both.

Note: A roll of a ‘1’ is always a miss, and a
roll of a ‘6’ is always a hit, regardless of any
modifiers.

Remove Casualties
After both players have completed their Combat roll
and Leader re–roll, they remove their losses.

The number of hits the opponent scored determines the
number of casualties that a player’s Army must take. The
attacker decides first how to remove his units, and casualties
are determined as follows:

For each hit scored by the opponent:

—

—

remove one Regular unit, or

replace one Elite unit with one Regular unit of the
same Nation.

For every two hits, the player can remove casualties as
above, twice, or can simply remove one Elite unit.

Example: A player has taken two hits. He can
either remove two Regular units, or can replace two
Elite units with two Regular ones, or can remove
one Elite unit.

When replacing one Elite unit with a Regular one, the
Regular unit can be taken from the previous casualties (if
any). Otherwise, the player takes the replacement from
the available reinforcements, if able. Any Elite units thus
replaced by the Free Peoples player are placed among the
casualties. If no Regular units are available in either the
casualties or the reinforcements, the Elite unit cannot be
replaced and is eliminated without further effect.

Free Peoples and Shadow Casualties
As described earlier, casualties taken among the Free Peoples
units are placed aside and are considered out of the game.
It is therefore important that casualties not be placed in the
same area as the available Free Peoples reinforcements.

The Shadow player, on the other hand, does not have this
problem, and his units are never out of the game. Shadow
casualties may therefore be placed back with the available
reinforcements.

Elimination of Leaders and Characters
If all the Army units involved in a battle are eliminated,
then all Leaders (including Characters) that were part
of that Army are also immediately removed from play.

Just like with Army casualties, Free Peoples Leaders are
permanently out of the game. Nazgûl can still re–enter as
reinforcements.

Characters (including all Shadow Minions — Saruman, the
Mouth of Sauron and the Witch–king) that are eliminated
are always permanently removed from the game unless their
Character card specifies otherwise.

Note that Characters in a region without friendly Army units
are never drawn into battle, as they can exist in a region that
contains enemy Army units. Except as a result of certain
Event card effects, Characters (Minions and Companions)
are only vulnerable when accompanying a friendly Army in
battle, and can therefore be deviously difficult to eliminate.

Choose to Cease the Attack, or Retreat
At the end of each Combat round, the attacking player has
the option to cease the attack.

If the attacker chooses to continue the battle, however,
then the defender has the option to retreat. If the defender
declines to retreat, another Combat round is initiated.

If the attacking Army ceases its attack, then its surviving units
simply remain where they were at the start of the battle.

30 • War of the Ring — Second Edition

Chapter VI: Armies and Battles • 31

If the defending player chooses to retreat, however, his
entire Army must immediately retreat to an adjacent free
region. If no such region is available, the defender cannot
choose to retreat.

Retreating into a Siege
As soon as the defender retreats into a siege, the region
around the Stronghold is left open to the enemy, who may
immediately advance into the region.

Special Exceptions:
—

An Army defending a region that contains a friendly
Stronghold may retreat into the Stronghold itself at
the beginning of any Combat round by Retreating
into a siege (see later).

—

—

A besieged Army cannot retreat.

If the retreating Army contains a Character of Level
0, that Character is left behind in the region.

End of Battle
A battle ends when the attacker ceases to fight, the
defender retreats, or when one or both Armies are
completely eliminated.

If the defending Army is eliminated or retreats, the attacker
may immediately move all or part of the attacking Army
into the embattled region.

If an embattled region invaded by a successful attacker
contains an enemy Stronghold, and that Stronghold
contains enemy units, the Stronghold becomes besieged
(see Attacking a Stronghold, below).

If the attacking Army chooses to advance, the Stronghold is
now considered under siege and the battle is over.

The defending figures are now considered to be inside
the Stronghold itself and are placed in the appropriate
Stronghold Box found on the game board (if needed for
space considerations).

A Stronghold under siege can contain a maximum of five
Army units (and any number of Leaders). Any unit in
excess of five is removed immediately when a Stronghold
comes under siege. Units removed in this way can re–enter
the game later as reinforcements.

A siege ends if the attacking Army leaves the region, or if
at any time the attacking or defending Army is completely
eliminated.

During the siege, the region surrounding the Stronghold
is considered free for the besieging player, while the
Stronghold itself remain controlled by the player under siege.

When a siege ends, move any surviving defenders from the
Stronghold Box to its region on the map again.

FORTIFICATIONS, CITIES,
STRONGHOLDS, AND SIEGES
Many battles in The Lord of the Rings were fought as armies
sought to either defend or conquer a fortress, ford, city,
or the like. Fortifications, Cities, and Strongholds are
therefore a central element in War of the Ring, as detailed
in the following rules.

ATTACKING A CITY OR FORTIFICATION
During an attack against an enemy defending a region
containing a City or Fortification, during the first round
of combat only the attacker hits on a result of ‘6’ or higher
(instead of ‘5’ or higher).

After the first Combat round is resolved, normal rules
apply.

ATTACKING A STRONGHOLD
When attacking an enemy defending a region containing
a Stronghold, before every combat round, the defender
must choose to either fight a field battle or retreat into a
siege.

Fighting a Field Battle
A field battle is resolved normally as described before.

32 • War of the Ring — Second Edition

CONDUCTING A SIEGE
When a Stronghold is under siege, the troops within can
only be attacked by an Army in the same region using an
Action die for battle during the Action Resolution phase.

Any battle starting against a besieged Army is considered a
siege battle.

During a siege battle, the attacker hits only on a result of
‘6’ or higher, while the defender hits on a result of ‘5’ or
higher as normal.

Also, unlike a normal combat, a siege battle only lasts
for one Combat round, unless the attacker decides to
voluntarily reduce one of his participating Elite units to
a Regular unit. If the attacker decides to do so, the siege
battle lasts for an additional round.

It is possible to extend a siege battle repeatedly, as long as
the attacker has available Elite units to reduce at the end of
a round.

If a siege battle ends and there are still defending and
besieging units left, the defenders are still considered under
siege.

Restrictions
—

A defending Army under siege may never choose to
retreat to an adjacent region.

—

An Army besieging a Stronghold is free to move
away from the region. If no Army units are left
behind, the Stronghold is no longer under siege.

SORTIE
An Army inside a Stronghold under siege may attack the
besieging Army by using an Action die for battle during the
Action Resolution phase.

A battle in which the attacker is under siege is called a
sortie.

In a sortie, the besieged Army fights a field battle for at
least one round, forfeiting the advantages of defending the
Stronghold.

A rearguard (see Splitting an Attacking Army, on page 28)
may be formed and left behind in the Stronghold.

Combat is resolved normally (with both Armies scoring hits
on a ‘5’ or higher) but, if the attacker wants to cease the
battle, the attacking Army moves back into the Stronghold.

The besieging defending Army may retreat to a free
adjacent region as usual.

If the attacking Army wins the sortie, it cannot advance
outside of the region.

RELIEVING A SIEGE
An Army in an adjacent region can attack an enemy Army
besieging a friendly Stronghold using the normal rules.

The Army inside the Stronghold does not participate in the
battle.

The attacking Army cannot advance into the region
containing the Stronghold unless the besieging Army is
destroyed or retreats.

REINFORCING A SIEGE
While a Stronghold is under siege, the besieging player
can move new troops into the region (because it is a free
region). This is considered a movement, not an attack.

CAPTURING A SETTLEMENT
At the start of the game, all Settlements belong to the
Nation in which their region is located.

A settlement is considered captured when:

—

—

An enemy Army enters a region containing a City, or
Town, or unoccupied Stronghold, or

All the units defending a Stronghold are eliminated
and the besieging Army still has at least one unit
remaining in the region.

The capturing player places a Settlement Control marker
on the region to indicate his control.

A captured City, Town or Stronghold cannot be used for
mustering troops or advancing the Political Track.

Captured Cities and Strongholds award the capturing
player Victory points for the purpose of determining a
Military Victory (see page 44). Advance the Victory Point
marker of the capturing player on the Victory Point Track
by one step for a captured City, or two steps for a captured
Stronghold.

If the original owner of the region is able to recapture it,
the Settlement Control marker is removed and any Victory
points earned from the conquest are lost.

The end of the Third Age was a dark time for Middle-earth.

While the basic allegiances of the Free Peoples were clearly
defined, their individual opinions towards the threat of
Sauron differed widely. The diplomatic stance of the various
Nations is represented in War of the Ring by a Nation’s position
on the Political Track found on the game board.

THE POLITICAL TRACK
The initial starting position of a Nation on the Political Track
(marked by the individual Nation’s icon on the track itself)
represents its diplomatic attitude at the beginning of the war.
The farther its Political counter is from the “At War” step of the
track, the less inclined that Nation is to take part in the conflict.

For a Nation to be considered completely mobilized and ready
to fight, its Political counter must be in the last step in the
track, marked “At War.”

To further reflect their reluctance in entering the war, all
the Free Peoples Nations except the Elves start the game in
a passive state (represented by the gray side of a Nation’s
Political counter facing up).

As long as a Nation remains passive, it can never be moved
to the last step of the track (“At War”) and thus be fully
mobilized.

ACTIVATING FREE PEOPLES NATIONS
The Political counter of a Free Peoples Nation is turned to the
active side (with the light blue side face up) when any of the
following events occur:

—

—

—

A region of that Nation is entered by an enemy Army.

An Army containing units of that Nation is attacked.

The Fellowship of the Ring is declared in a City or
Stronghold of that Nation.

—  When a Companion (capable of activating that Nation)
ends his movement or enters play in one of its Cities or
Strongholds, unless it is controlled by the enemy.

Each Companion card has a symbol, in its lower right-
hand corner, that indicates which Free Peoples Nation
the Companion is capable of activating upon ending his
movement (or entering play) in one of that Nation’s Cities or
Strongholds.

Dwarves

Elves

Gondor

Isengard

The North

Rohan

Southrons &
Easterlings

Sauron

Note that Gandalf, Aragorn, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and
Peregrin Took all show the “Free Peoples” symbol rather than
one specific Nation’s symbol. These Characters are capable
of activating any Free Peoples Nation upon ending their
movement in one of its Cities or Strongholds.

ADVANCING A POLITICAL POSITION
The Political counter of a Nation is advanced (by moving it
down a step toward the “At War” step) on the Political Track
by using a Muster Action die result or by playing certain Event
cards.

Additionally, the counter of a Nation is automatically advanced
one step if any of the following events occur:

—

Every time an Army containing units of that Nation is
attacked (each battle counts as one attack regardless of
the number of rounds fought). Also, remember that
when a Nation’s Army is attacked, that Nation becomes
active.

—

Every time a Nation’s Settlement (Town, City, or
Stronghold) is captured by the opponent.

34 • War of the Ring — Second Edition

Chapter VII: The Politics of Middle-Earth • 35

Example: The Shadow player is attacking an Army
of the North in the City of Dale. After the first round
of combat, the Free Peoples player decides to retreat
the only surviving North Regular unit. The Shadow
Army advances into the now captured City and places
a Control marker on it. As a result, the North nation
is activated and its Political counter is moved two
steps on the Political Track since a North Army was
attacked and a North City captured by the Shadow.

CHARACTERS AT WAR
Companions, Minions, and Nazgûl can freely move and be
involved in battles regardless of the political position of the
Nation they belong to. In essence, they should be considered
already “At War.”

Example: The Nazgûl can participate in an attack
even if Sauron is not yet “At War.”

EVENT CARDS AFFECTING THE POLITICAL TRACK
All cards that initiate an attack by an Army can trigger a
political reaction (activation and/or advancement on the
Political Track). The three “Ents Awake” Event cards and
the “Dead Men of Dunharrow” Event card can also trigger
a political reaction. The effects of these cards are considered
to be battles in which the enemy Army cannot fight back. All
other cards that trigger a political reaction have the political
effect explicitly stated in the text.

ENTERING WAR
A Nation that is not “At War” is considered to be non-belligerent.

A non-belligerent Nation suffers various limits to the
capabilities of its troops.

In detail, Army units and Leaders of a non-belligerent Nation
must adhere to the following restrictions:

—

—

—

They can move outside their National borders but
can never move across the borders of other Nations
(including friendly ones).

They cannot attack enemy Armies (but can defend if
attacked).

They can never be recruited by using Muster Action die
results.

All the restrictions listed above apply even if figures of a non-
belligerent Nation are stacked with figures of a Nation “At War.”

Exception: Non-belligerent figures are allowed to cross
another Nation’s border when retreating from a battle. If they
do so, the next time they move, they must move out of that
Nation, unless they became “At War” in the meantime.

Example: Two North units in Dale retreat from a
battle. Even if the North is not “At War,” the units
may retreat to Erebor (which belongs to the Dwarf
Nation). They could not do this as a normal move, but
this move is possible as a retreat from combat.

When a Nation’s Political counter moves into the last step
of the Political Track, that Nation is now “At War.”

A Nation “At War” is free from the constraints binding a
non-belligerent Nation. Its Armies may freely move across all
National borders and attack enemy Armies, and its troops can
be recruited using Muster Action die results.

As noted before, a passive Free Peoples Nation can never enter
the “At War” step, but must be activated first.

In War of the Ring, Frodo and Sam are inseparable and are

represented collectively as the Ring-bearers. As told in
The Lord of the Rings, the two Hobbits are accompanied
by a number of Companions, chosen from among the Free
Peoples of Middle-earth.

These Characters together form the Fellowship of the
Ring. While Frodo and Sam are bent on reaching Mount
Doom to complete their quest, the other Companions have
a choice: they can stay and protect the Fellowship, or, in
time, leave the Fellowship in order to help the Free Peoples
of the West in their struggle against the Shadow.

FELLOWSHIP FIGURES AND
COUNTERS
The Fellowship of the Ring is represented in the game by a
number of figures and counters.

—

—

—

The Ring-bearers figure (Frodo & Sam) indicates
the last known position of the Fellowship. It is placed
in the region where the Fellowship was last declared
or revealed (see page 38). At the start of the game, it
is placed in Rivendell. Whenever rules or Event cards
refer to the current location of the Fellowship, it is
determined by the position of this figure, regardless
of the position of the Fellowship Progress counter
(see below).

The Fellowship Progress counter shows how far
the Fellowship has traveled from its last known
position and indicates whether the Fellowship is
Hidden or Revealed. This counter is placed on the
Fellowship Track on the game board and is moved
a step forward each time the Fellowship advances.

The Companion figures and counters (seven
individual Characters) represent the heroes of the
Free Peoples. Initially their figures and counters
are placed in the Fellowship of the Ring Box on
the game board to indicate that they are all part
of the Fellowship. When a Companion leaves the
Fellowship, his figure is moved from the box to the
map and his counter is removed from the Fellowship
Box.

THE RING-BEARERS
The Ring-bearers figure depicts Frodo and Sam together,
since in War of the Ring these two Hobbits can never be
separated from one another or leave the Fellowship. Hence,
the position of the Ring-bearers is always the one indicated
by this figure.

CORRUPTION
The growing burden of carrying the One Ring to its
destruction is represented by the Corruption of the Ring-
bearers, a numerical score that starts at zero points but can
increase to 12.

Upon reaching 12 Corruption points, the Ring-bearers
are immediately assumed to have failed in their mission,
succumbing to the power of the One Ring, and the game is
won by the Shadow.

The Free Peoples player keeps track of the Corruption
of the Ring-bearers by moving the Corruption counter
along the Fellowship Track on the game board (which also
contains the Fellowship Progress counter), placing it upon
the corresponding numbered space.

36 • War of the Ring — Second Edition

Chapter VIII: The Fellowship of the Ring • 37

COMPANION CHARACTER CARDS
Each Companion and his abilities are described on his
Character card (see page 25).

At the beginning of the game, all Companions are in the
Fellowship and their cards are stacked together to form the
Fellowship deck (set aside the cards of Gollum, Aragorn –
Heir to Isildur and Gandalf the White).

The deck is placed in the Guide of the Fellowship Box on the
game board. As long as a Companion is in the Fellowship,
his corresponding card is left in the Fellowship deck.

When a Companion leaves the Fellowship, his card is
removed from the deck and placed on the table in front of
the Free Peoples player.

Each Character card contains the following information
about the depicted Companion:

—  His Level, a number that is used during the Hunt
for the Ring (see Effects of the Hunt, page 41) and
when moving the Companion.

—  His Nation icon, indicating which Nations the

Companion is able to activate.

—  His Special Ability that is only in effect when he is

the Guide of the Fellowship (see later).

—  His Special Ability that is in effect after he has left

the Fellowship.

—  His Leadership Rating used in battle.

THE GUIDE OF THE FELLOWSHIP
One of the Companions in the Fellowship is considered to
be the Guide of the group during its quest.

At the beginning of each game of War of the Ring that
Companion is Gandalf the Grey.

The Guide must always be the remaining Companion who
has the highest Level. In case of a tie in Levels, the Free
Peoples player can choose the Guide between the tying
Companions.

Example: During the first turn of the game, the
Fellowship player may replace Gandalf as guide
with Strider, since both are Level 3 Companions.

The Free Peoples player may nominate a new Guide at the
end of each Fellowship phase, or when, during the course of
a turn, the composition of the Fellowship changes (due to a
Character being separated or eliminated from the Fellowship).

Even when changing guides during the Fellowship phase,
however, only a Character that has or shares the highest
Level may be designated as the Guide.

The Character card of the Companion acting as the Guide
is always kept as the topmost card of the Fellowship deck,
so that his special abilities are readily accessible.

When a Companion is acting as the Guide, only his special
ability that is marked “Guide:” (if present) can be employed.
Any other special abilities listed on the card are not available,
as they apply only after that Companion leaves the Fellowship.

Gollum as a Guide
If all Companions have left the Fellowship, the Ring-
bearers are alone and Gollum becomes the Guide of the
Fellowship. When this happens, the Gollum Character card
is placed in the Guide of the Fellowship Box.

THE FELLOWSHIP TRACK
To keep track of the secret movements of the Ring-bearers,
players employ the Fellowship Track.

The Ring-bearers figure is used on the game board to
mark the last known position of the Fellowship, but only
the Fellowship Progress counter is advanced on the
Fellowship Track every time the Fellowship moves.

The higher the number reached on the Fellowship Track,
the farther from its last known position the Fellowship is at
that moment.

MOVING THE FELLOWSHIP
During the Action Resolution phase, the Free Peoples
player may advance the Fellowship Progress counter by
using a Character result on an Action die, or by using
certain Event cards.

Every time the Fellowship moves, the Fellowship Progress
counter is advanced one step on the Fellowship Track
(keeping the Progress counter on the Hidden side).

After each time the Fellowship Progress counter moves,
the Shadow player has a chance to Hunt for the moving
Fellowship (see later). The Dark Lord of Mordor hopes to
regain his precious Ring by corrupting the Ring-bearers,
killing the Companions, or, at the very least, locating the
whereabouts of the Fellowship.

If the Fellowship moves more than once in a turn, the Hunt
becomes increasingly dangerous: every time that an Action die
is used to move the Fellowship, that die is added to the Hunt
Box after the Hunt has been completed (each added die will
provide a bonus to the Hunt roll, as explained on page 41).

Exception: When the Free Peoples player moves the
Fellowship using an Event card, the Action die used to play
the card is not added to the Hunt Box.

Any Action dice that the Free Peoples player places in the
Hunt Box are returned to him at the beginning of the next
turn.

38 • War of the Ring — Second Edition

LOCATING THE FELLOWSHIP
The numbered steps on the Fellowship Track represent the
distance (measured in regions) traveled by the Fellowship
from its last known position (the region where the Ring-
bearers figure is located).

The actual position of the Fellowship is determined only if
one of two things happen:

1)

2)

The Free Peoples player decides to declare the
position of the Fellowship, or

A Hunt for the Ring is successful and reveals the
Fellowship.

Both circumstances cause the Ring-bearers figure to move
to a new position on the game board and the Fellowship
Progress counter to be reset to  ‘0.’

When the Ring-bearers figure is moved on the game board,
it cannot cross a black border (which denotes impassable
terrain).

Note that if the Fellowship Progress counter is on step ‘0’
of the Fellowship Track when declared or revealed, the
Fellowship must remain in the same region as before (as, in
fact, it has not moved).

There are important differences between “declaring” and
“revealing” the Fellowship that need further explaining (see
below).

Fellowship Declares Its Own Position
If the Fellowship is Hidden (the Progress counter
shows the Hidden side up), its position can be declared
by the Free Peoples player during the Fellowship phase.

This declaration usually happens because the Free Peoples
player wants to have the Ring-bearers heal from Corruption
in a City or Stronghold, wants to activate a Nation, or
wants to use an Event card that requires the Ring-bearers to
be in a specific place.

When the Fellowship is declared, the Free Peoples player
may immediately move the Ring-bearers figure a number
of regions (from its last known position), equal to or less
than the number on the Fellowship Track indicated by the
position of the Fellowship Progress counter. (The Free
Peoples player may choose to leave the Ring-bearers figure
in its current position, if he wants.)

Then, the Free Peoples player resets the Fellowship
Progress counter, moving it back to the ‘0’ step of the
Fellowship Track. The Fellowship Progress counter remains
Hidden side up.

Example: The Free Peoples player, during the
Fellowship phase of the fourth game turn, decides
to declare the position of the Fellowship. The last
known position of the Fellowship, and thus the
location of the Ring-bearers figure, is in Rivendell
and the Fellowship Progress counter is at  ‘5.’

The player moves the Ring-bearers through Fords
of Bruinen, Hollin, Moria, and Dimrill Dale
and into Lórien. The Fellowship Progress counter
is returned to the ‘0’ step of the Fellowship Track.
The Fellowship is still Hidden, in the safety of
the golden wood of Lórien. If the Ring-bearers
suffered Corruption, one Corruption point could
now be healed as the Fellowship is in a Free Peoples
Stronghold.

Note: The Fellowship may enter or leave a
besieged Stronghold freely.

Fellowship is Revealed by a Hunt for the Ring
If the Fellowship is Hidden, its position can be revealed
by the Shadow player as a result of a successful Hunt,
or if the Shadow Player plays certain Event cards.

When the Fellowship is revealed, turn the Fellowship
Progress counter to its Revealed side, after which the
Free Peoples player must move the Ring-bearers figure
(as described in the previous section), except that this
movement can never end in a region containing a Free
Peoples Stronghold or City controlled by the Free Peoples.

IMPORTANT: Once the Fellowship has been
revealed, it cannot be moved by the Free Peoples
player using a Character Action die until it is
Hidden again.

Moreover, a Revealed Fellowship is more vulnerable to
certain Shadow Event cards aimed at hurting the Ring-
bearers or hindering the Fellowship’s progress.

Example: During the second game turn,
a successful Hunt reveals the position of the
Fellowship. The last known position of the Fellowship
was in Rivendell and the Fellowship Progress
counter is at ‘3’ on the Fellowship Track.

The Free Peoples player could move the Ring-bearers
through Fords of Bruinen and Hollin and into
Moria, but moving into the Moria region (with
its Shadow Stronghold) would mean drawing
an additional Hunt tile (see below). So, the Free
Peoples player decides instead to move the Ring-
bearers through Fords of Bruinen and High Pass
and into Goblin’s Gate. The Fellowship Progress
counter is put on the ‘0’ step of the Fellowship Track,
and flipped to the Revealed side. The Fellowship
must be Hidden before it may move again.

The Fellowship in Shadow Strongholds
When the Fellowship is revealed, and its path traced from
its last known position, if the Fellowship moves through,
moves from, moves into, or remains stationary in a Shadow
Stronghold still controlled by the Shadow player, then
a Hunt tile is immediately drawn as if a Hunt has been
successful.

38 • War of the Ring — Second Edition

Chapter VIII: The Fellowship of the Ring • 39

If the path is traced through more than one Shadow
Stronghold, one Hunt tile is drawn for each Stronghold
involved.

This drawing of a Hunt tile is done only if the Fellowship is
revealed by the Shadow player. Moreover, it is in addition
to any other effects of a successful Hunt. Hunt tiles are
explained in more detail on page 40.

HIDING THE FELLOWSHIP
The Free Peoples player can use a Character result on an
Action die during the Action Resolution phase (or can play
an appropriate Event card), to hide a Revealed Fellowship,
turning the Fellowship Progress counter to its Hidden side.

Note that using a Character Action die to hide the
Fellowship does not allow it to also move during that
action (and the used die is not added to the Hunt Box).
The Free Peoples player must later use another Character
die to move the Hidden Fellowship once again.

Remember that it is necessary for the Fellowship to be
Hidden in order for it to move.

HEALING THE RING-BEARER
The Ring-bearers can receive some relief from the burden
of the Ring by resting in an appropriate sanctuary.

Thus, if during the Fellowship phase the Fellowship is
declared in a region that contains a Free Peoples City
or Stronghold not under enemy control, one point of
Corruption is immediately removed (to a minimum of
zero Corruption). The Free Peoples player adjusts the
position of the Corruption counter on the Fellowship Track
accordingly.

If the Fellowship remains in a City or Stronghold for several
turns, during the Fellowship phase of each turn it is possible
to declare them in that region and heal one Corruption
each time.

ENTERING MORDOR
Mordor is the realm of the Dark Lord. Its mountains are
almost impossible to climb and its passes are well guarded.
Therefore, some of the normal Fellowship rules do not
apply there.

Sooner or later during most games, the Fellowship should
eventually reach either the region of Morannon or Minas
Morgul. It is mandatory that the Fellowship is in either of
these locations during a Fellowship phase to begin the last
part of the journey to Mount Doom (see The Fellowship in
Mordor, page 43).

SEPARATING COMPANIONS
FROM THE FELLOWSHIP
While a Companion remains in the Fellowship, he may not
have any influence on the game except for his “Guide”
ability (if he is the Guide) and for his influence on the Hunt
for the Ring (see pages 40-43).

To participate in battles and in the politics of Middle-earth,
he must be separated from the Fellowship.

During the Action Resolution phase, the Free Peoples
player can separate one Companion (or a group of
Companions) from the Fellowship by using a Character
Action die result (unless the Fellowship is on the
Mordor Track, where this is prohibited, see page 43).

When a Companion separates from the Fellowship, the
figure of the separated Companion is moved from the
Fellowship Box to the region on the map where the Ring-
bearers are located.

The Companion may then move a number of regions up
to the number of the step of the Fellowship Track the
Fellowship Progress counter is on, plus his Companion
Level.

If the Free Peoples player separates a group of
Companions, he moves their figures together to one region
that can be reached by the Companion with the highest
Level in the group.

The movement of separated Companions follows the same
rules as that of Character movement, as outlined on page
24. Note that if the Ring-bearers figure is currently located
in a region containing a Stronghold under siege that is
controlled by the Free Peoples, the Companion(s) will
separate into the Stronghold and may not leave.

When separating Companions, the Free Peoples player
removes their Character cards from the Fellowship deck and
removes the Companion counters from the Fellowship Box
as well.

Example: The Fellowship’s last known position is in
Rivendell, and the Fellowship Progress counter is
currently on the fifth step of the Fellowship Track.
The Free Peoples player decides to separate Legolas
(Level 2) and Meriadoc (Level 1) as a group.
Legolas and Meriadoc can be moved up to 7 regions
(5+2) from Rivendell. The player decides to move
them together to the Woodland Realm.

If the Guide of the Fellowship is separated from the
Fellowship, one of the highest Level Companions remaining
in the Fellowship becomes the new Guide (or Gollum
becomes the Guide, if all the Companions have left).

Once a Companion separates from the Fellowship, he
can never rejoin.

Lord gathers rumors and sends out spies, hoping to finally
reclaim his long-lost treasure. These efforts are represented
in War of the Ring by the Hunt for the Ring.

THE HUNT POOL
The Hunt Pool is a set of cardboard tiles representing the
effects of a successful Hunt. These tiles should be placed
in an opaque container at the beginning of the game (such
as a cup or similar container), as one tile must be drawn
randomly each time the Hunt is successful.

If, at any time, all the tiles in the Hunt Pool have been
used, return all Standard tiles (beige) to the pool, but do
not return to the pool any special tiles (blue/red), or any
tile who has been “permanently removed” from the game
due to an Event card effect.

STANDARD HUNT TILES
Most of the standard Hunt tiles (which have a beige
background) show a numerical value, ranging from 0 to
3. This value represents the effectiveness of the successful
Hunt and is called Hunt damage.

SPECIAL HUNT TILES
The special Hunt tiles (which have either a blue background,
for the Fellowship special Hunt tiles, or a red background, for
the Shadow special Hunt tiles) are set aside at the beginning
of the game and enter play only by the use of Event cards.

When these Event cards are played, the special Hunt tile in
question is set aside until the Fellowship enters Mordor (see
page 43). When the Fellowship enters Mordor, any such
special Hunt tiles are added to the Hunt Pool.

If the Fellowship is already on the Mordor Track when a
special tile enters play, simply add the tile immediately to
the Hunt Pool.

Some of the special Hunt tiles show a negative value or a
random value, described as follows:

—

—

A negative value (–2 or –1) means that there is no
Hunt damage and instead the indicated number is
actually subtracted from the current Corruption
of the Ring-bearers on the Fellowship Track (to a
minimum of zero).

 means that the Hunt damage is equal

 in

HUNTING THE FELLOWSHIP

THE HUNT ROLL
Every time the Free Peoples player moves the
Fellowship, the Shadow player rolls dice to determine
the effect of the Hunt.

The effect of the Hunt is determined as follows.

First, the Shadow player determines the Hunt Level. The
Hunt Level is equal to the total number of Shadow Action
dice in the Hunt Box.

Note: These dice were placed in the Hunt
Box by the Shadow player during the Hunt
Allocation phase, plus any Eye dice that he
rolled during the Action roll phase.

40 • War of the Ring — Second Edition

Chapter IX: The Hunt for the Ring • 41

Then, the Shadow player makes a Hunt roll by rolling a
number of Combat dice equal to the Hunt Level. Each
result of ‘6’ is a success.

The maximum number of dice that can be rolled for a
Hunt roll is five. A Hunt Level in excess of five does not
add further dice to the roll.

Modifiers to the Hunt Roll
If the Fellowship has moved more than once per turn, the
Hunt becomes easier.

For every Action die that the Free Peoples player has
placed in the Hunt Box (a Free Peoples Action die is
placed here after every movement of the Fellowship, see
Moving the Fellowship, page 37), the Shadow player adds
+1 to each Hunt roll die result.

If a die result is ‘6’ or higher after this addition, it is a success.

Example: When the Fellowship moves for the first
time during a turn, the Shadow player needs to roll
‘6’ results on his Hunt dice to achieve a successful
Hunt. If the Fellowship, however, is moving for the
second time (after the Free Peoples player has used
an Action die for the first movement and placed it
in the Hunt Box), the Shadow player needs only to
roll a ‘5’ or ‘6’ for a successful Hunt.

Note: A roll of ‘1’ is always a failure,
regardless of any modifier.

Hunt Re-rolls
The presence of Sauron’s servants or Strongholds makes
movement of the Fellowship more dangerous.

If, during the Hunt, the Ring-bearers are in a region that
contains one or more of the following:

—

A Stronghold controlled by the Shadow player

—  One or more Shadow Army units

—  One or more Nazgûl

then, the Shadow player can, after the Hunt roll, re-roll one
failed Hunt roll die for each of these conditions that apply.

Example 1: Three Army units and two Nazgûl are
in the region that contains the Fellowship figure, so
the Shadow player may re-roll two dice (one for the
presence of Army units, and another for the presence
of the Nazgûl).

Example 2: One Nazgûl, four Army units, and a
Shadow Stronghold are in the region containing the
Fellowship figure, so the Shadow player may re-roll
three dice (because all the listed conditions apply).

Re-rolls also receive the +1 bonus for each Free Peoples die
in the Hunt Box.

HUNT EFFECTS WHEN DECLARING OR
REVEALING THE FELLOWSHIP
When the Free Peoples player declares the
Fellowship, certain abilities and events may force
him to draw a Hunt tile. When this happens, ignore
any Reveal icon on the drawn tile if the Fellowship
has been declared in a Free Peoples Stronghold or
City controlled by the Free Peoples.

When the Fellowship is revealed, if the Free
Peoples player is forced to draw multiple Hunt tiles
because of a Shadow Stronghold presence, events,
and abilities, each tile effect is resolved completely
before applying the following tile effect. First the
player resolves the effect of the tile that caused the
Fellowship to be revealed. Then he resolves all tiles
related to events and abilities. Lastly, he resolves the
tile drawn due to the Shadow Stronghold.

Example: A Hunt tile reveals the Fellowship in
Moria, and the “Balrog of Moria” card is in play.
Three Hunt tiles are drawn (one for the Hunt, one
for the Balrog, and one for the Shadow Stronghold).
First the player applies all effects due to the first
Hunt tile (the one which caused the Fellowship to
be revealed), then the effect of the tile drawn for the
Balrog card is resolved, and finally the effect of the
tile drawn for the Stronghold is resolved.

DETERMINING HUNT DAMAGE
If the Shadow player rolls at least one success on his Hunt
roll (including re-rolls), the Hunt is successful and the
Shadow player draws one tile from the Hunt Pool.

—

—

If the tile is numbered, its value represents the Hunt
damage inflicted to the Fellowship.

If the tile shows an Eye, the Hunt damage is equal to
the number of successes rolled in the Hunt roll (if such
a tile was drawn because of the Fellowship’s leaving
or entering a Shadow Stronghold, or due to an Event
card, the Eye is considered to have a value of 0).

—

If the tile has a Reveal icon on it, the Fellowship is
revealed after resolving any other effect.

EFFECTS OF THE HUNT
To deal with the effects of a successful Hunt, follow these
steps in order:

1)

2)

The Free Peoples player may use one relevant “Play
on the Table” Event card to cancel or reduce the
damage of the Hunt.

Then, the Free Peoples player may use the Guide’s
special ability. If, after these steps, the Hunt damage
is one or more, the Free Peoples player may decide to

42 • War of the Ring — Second Edition

reduce the Hunt damage by taking a casualty (see
below) — losing one Companion due to the hazards
encountered by the Fellowship, or a fight between
the Fellowship and servants of the Shadow.

3)

4)

Any remaining Hunt damage must be dealt with
by using the Ring (see below), increasing the
Corruption of the Ring-bearers.

If the Hunt reveals the Fellowship, the Fellowship is
now revealed (sometimes, revealing the Fellowship
may cause the draw of a new tile, see Hunt Effects
When Declaring or Revealing the Fellowship).

Note: If, at any time during the Hunt resolution,
a new Guide is appointed (this happens,
for example, when you use Meriadoc’s and
Peregrin’s Guide ability, or because the Guide
has been eliminated), the ability of the new
Guide may be used immediately, if applicable.

Taking a Casualty
If the Free Peoples player takes a casualty, he must
eliminate one Companion.

The Free Peoples player can decide between either
taking the Guide as a casualty or randomly picking one
Companion (excluding the Ring-bearers, but including
the Guide) from the Fellowship. If the Free Peoples player
decides to suffer a random casualty, the Shadow player
randomly selects a face-down Companion counter from the
Fellowship Box. The drawn Companion is eliminated from
the game.

If the Hunt damage is higher than the Level of the
eliminated Companion (including an eliminated Guide),
any excess damage must still be taken as Corruption by the
Ring-bearers (see below).

If the Hunt damage is lower than the Level of the
Companion, he is eliminated nonetheless (i.e., it is not
possible to “wound” Companions).

Using the Ring
When the Free Peoples player uses the Ring, he advances
the Corruption counter on the Fellowship Track by a
number of steps equal to the Hunt damage.

Example: During the fourth game turn, the Ring-
bearers are in the Goblin’s Gate region and the
Free Peoples player is moving the Fellowship Progress
counter from step ‘1’ to step ‘2’ of the Fellowship
Track.

There are three Shadow dice in the Hunt Box and
one Free Peoples die, as this is the second time the
Fellowship has moved this turn.

The Shadow player rolls three Combat dice: he
must roll at least one ‘5’ or ‘6’ for the Hunt to be
successful. He rolls ‘2,’ ‘5,’ and ‘6’: a total of two

successes (the Shadow player needed only one success
for the Hunt to succeed). He then draws a random
tile from the Hunt Pool: a tile with a ‘3’ and no
Reveal icon. The Hunt damage must be resolved.

There are no cards or Character’s abilities to be
used, and the Free Peoples player decides to take
a casualty. Strider is guiding the Fellowship, and
the player does not want him to die, so he decides
to draw a random Character instead. All the
Companion counters are shuffled and one is chosen
randomly: Gimli is drawn. The valiant dwarf dies
confronting the servants of the Shadow. As Gimli’s
Level is 2, and the Hunt damage is 3, 1 point of
Hunt damage remains to be taken as Corruption,
and the Corruption of the Ring-bearers increases.

Because the tile does not have a Reveal icon, the
Fellowship Progress counter’s Hidden side remains
face up.

THE ONE RING AND THE QUEST
FOR MOUNT DOOM
Even as the Dark Lord desperately searches for the One
Ring, he cannot imagine that someone would bring it
to Mordor. Consequently, he does not look for the Ring
within the borders of his own land.

In War of the Ring, from the moment the One Ring
reaches the borders of Mordor, events are set in motion
that are mostly beyond the control of the players
themselves. The real struggle now lies between the will of
the Ring to return to its Master and the determination of
the Ring-bearers to pursue their mission to its bitter end.

Corruption Counter

The Position of the Corruption counter on
the Fellowship Track is used to record the
Corruption of the Ring-bearers.

42 • War of the Ring — Second Edition

Chapter IX: The Hunt for the Ring • 43

THE BURDEN OF THE RING
The physical, mental, and moral struggle of the Ring-
bearers is represented by Corruption.

Corruption is added to the Ring-bearers each time that the
Ring is used to counter the effects of a successful Hunt, or
as a result of various Event cards.

Corruption is removed from the Ring-bearers by resting in
a friendly City or Stronghold or by the use of certain special
abilities and Event cards.

Each time Corruption is added or removed, the Free
Peoples player adjusts the Corruption counter on the
Fellowship Track accordingly.

As soon as the Corruption counter reaches 12 Corruption
points on the Fellowship Track, the Free Peoples player
immediately loses the game.

THE FELLOWSHIP IN MORDOR
In Mordor, the power of the Dark Lord is everywhere, and
the burden of the Ring becomes heavier with every step.
The Mordor Track is the final part of the quest to destroy
the One Ring.

The track is represented by the circles superimposed on the
Gorgoroth region on the map. Note that the circles are
not actually considered to be part of that region, and the
Fellowship is not considered to be in the Gorgoroth region,
or any other region, when on the Mordor Track.

If the Fellowship is in Minas Morgul or Morannon during
a Fellowship phase, the Free Peoples player may decide to
enter Mordor. In this case, immediately proceed to the
following steps (after fully resolving the declaration of the
Fellowship’s position, if necessary):

1)

2)

Place the Ring-bearers figure on the first step of the
Mordor Track (labeled with the Elven numeral ‘0’).
From this moment on, the Fellowship is considered
to be “On the Mordor Track.” The Fellowship
Progress counter is no longer advanced on the
Fellowship Track, but it is still used to show whether
the Fellowship is Hidden or Revealed.

Create a new Hunt Pool by placing all Eye tiles
previously drawn back with the remaining tiles of the
Hunt Pool, and also add any special tiles put in play by
Event cards. Do not place back in the pool any Eye tile
which was permanently removed from the game.

Special Rules
The following special rules apply when the Fellowship is on
the Mordor Track:

—

Companions in the Fellowship can never be
separated, either as a result of using Action dice or as
the effect of special abilities or Event cards. Anything
that would normally separate a Companion removes
him from the game instead.

—  When the Free Peoples player tries to move the

Fellowship during the Action Resolution phase, do
not roll the Hunt dice. Instead, automatically draw
one tile from the Hunt Pool. The effects of this tile
are applied normally as for a successful Hunt, except
for the following:

—

If the tile drawn shows an Eye, the Hunt
damage is equal to the number of dice in
the Hunt Box (including Free Peoples dice
previously used for moving the Fellowship
during the same turn).

—  Normally the Fellowship advances one step on

the Mordor Track when moving. However, if the
tile shows a Stop icon, the Fellowship remains
on the same step and does not move forward.

The Fellowship is still required to be Hidden in
order to advance on the Mordor Track. If the
Fellowship is Revealed, the Free Peoples player must,
as normal, use a Character Action die result to hide
the Fellowship once again.

If, at the end of the Action Resolution phase, the
Free Peoples player has not attempted to move or
hide the Fellowship on the Mordor Track during
that turn, one Corruption is automatically added to
the Ring-bearers.

—

—

—  When the Fellowship has completed all five steps

on the Mordor Track, the Crack of Doom has been
reached and the Free Peoples player wins the game
(unless the Ring-bearers have reached 12 Corruption
points, see page 44).

M O R D O R   T R A C K
M O R D O R   T R A C K

—

The Mordor Track is not considered a part of
the Gorgoroth region.

—  When the Fellowship enters Mordor, the

Ring-bearers figure is put on the first circle of
the track.

—

If the Fellowship enters the Crack of Doom
and the Ring-bearers are not at 12 Corruption,
the Free Peoples player wins the game.

There are four ways to win the game. Two Victory

conditions may be triggered at any moment during
a turn (see Ring-based Victory Conditions, below),

while the other two Victory conditions apply only during
phase 6 of the turn, the Victory Check (see Military
Victory Conditions, below).

If any of these conditions apply, the game ends with a
Victory for one of the players.

Note that lower-numbered Victory conditions take
precedence over higher-numbered Victory conditions, if
two or more are achieved on the same turn.

RING-BASED VICTORY CONDITIONS
The most important goal for Sauron is to reclaim the One
Ring, while the most important goal for the Free Peoples is
to destroy the Ring.

For this reason, if either of those two events occur at any
time during a turn, the game ends immediately without
waiting for the Victory Check phase.

1)

Corruption of the Ring-bearers: If the Ring-
bearers have 12 or more Corruption points, they
failed their quest. Sauron regains the Ring for
himself and the Shadow player wins the game.

2)  Destroying the Ring: If the Ring-bearers figure is
on the “Crack of Doom” step on the Mordor Track
and the Ring-bearers have fewer than 12 Corruption
points, the Ring is destroyed. Sauron is utterly
vanquished and the Free Peoples player wins the
game.

MILITARY VICTORY CONDITIONS
In The Lord of the Rings, if Sauron had succeeded in
destroying the Nations of the Free Peoples, even the
destruction of the Ring could not have resulted in a proper
victory for the Free Peoples.

At the same time, if the Free Peoples had successfully
challenged Sauron militarily, the Dark Lord would have
needed to greatly focus on the struggle against the Armies
of the Free Peoples, and it would have been much easier for
the Ring-bearers to reach Mount Doom.

Thus, if at the end of a game turn any of the following two
conditions apply, the game ends with a military victory.

The   symbol
appearing on a City
is a reminder that
control of this region
is worth 1 Victory
point to the opponent.

The     symbol
appearing on a
Stronghold is a
reminder that control
of this Stronghold is
worth 2 Victory points
to the opponent.

3)

4)

The Shadow Conquers Middle-earth: If the
Shadow player controls Free Peoples Settlements
worth 10 or more Victory points, he wins.

Sauron is Banished from Middle-earth: If the Free
Peoples player controls Shadow Settlements worth 4
or more Victory points, he wins.

Military Victory conditions are based on the control of a
Settlement.

For the purposes of a Military Victory, a player controls an
enemy Settlement if it has that player’s Settlement Control
marker on it.

Each enemy City a player controls is worth 1 Victory point,
while each enemy Stronghold a player controls is worth 2
Victory points.

Players use their their Victory Point markers and the
Victory Point track to keep count of the Victory point value
of their conquests.

I n a three- or four-player game, each player represents

one of the major powers in The Lord of the Rings and
controls some of the Nations and certain Characters.

FOUR-PLAYER GAME
In a four-player game, the player responsibilities are broken
down as follows:

Free Peoples:
—

Player 1: Gondor (also controls the Elves)

—

Player 2: Rohan (also controls the North and
Dwarves)

Shadow:
—

Player 1: The Witch-king (the Sauron Nation)

—

Player 2: Saruman and Sauron Allies (Isengard and
Southron & Easterling Nations)

All the rules in the standard game apply, with the following
exceptions.

At the beginning of the game, the Gondor player and the
Witch-king player take the “Leading Player” tokens.

At the beginning of each turn (excluding Turn 1), the
Leading Player in a team passes the “Leading Player” token
to his teammate.

EVENT DRAW
On Turn 1, each player draws one card from each of their
respective Event decks.

On the following turns, each player draws one card from one
Event deck of his choice.

After drawing cards, and discarding excess cards, players in
the same team may agree to swap one of their cards with their
teammate.

The players cannot show or discuss the cards. They can only
tell each other if they want to swap one card or not. A card is
swapped only if both players agree.

In a four-player game, each player’s hand limit is four cards
instead of six.

FELLOWSHIP PHASE
The Leading Player on the Free Peoples team decides
whether to declare the Fellowship or not and who the
Guide of the Fellowship is.

HUNT ALLOCATION AND ACTION ROLL
The Leading Player on the Shadow team decides how many
Action dice to place in the Hunt Box.

The Leading Player of each team rolls the Action dice.

ACTION RESOLUTION
The Free Peoples team goes first.

The non-Leading Player on the Free Peoples team chooses
an Action die and uses it for any of the Nations he controls
or for any action relating to the Fellowship or any individual
Companions, such as moving or hiding the Fellowship or
moving Companions on the map.

Then the non-Leading Player in the Shadow team uses an
Action die, followed by the Leading Player on the Free Peoples
team, and then the Leading Player on the Shadow team.

The actions are all taken in that order until both teams have
used all of their Action dice.

If a player decides to pass an action, he is still entitled to take
his next action after the opposing team has taken their action.

LIMITS ON ACTIONS
Each player only controls certain Nations and can only use
his Action dice and Event cards to recruit, move, or fight
with Armies of these Nations. Only the player who controls a
Nation may move the Political counter of that nation, unless
the special ability of a Character is used.

For rules concerning regions containing units of Nations
controlled by both players on a team, see Mixed Armies, below.

SUMMARY
Free Peoples
—

The Gondor player controls the Gondor and Elven
Nations.

—

—

—

—

The Rohan player controls the Rohan, North, and
Dwarven Nations.

Any player may move or hide the Fellowship.

Any player may move or separate Companions.

The effects of the Hunt on the Fellowship are
decided and applied by the Leading Player.

46 • War of the Ring — Second Edition

Shadow Armies
—

The Witch-king player controls the Sauron Nation,
the Witch-king, and the Mouth of Sauron.

EVENTS
Normally, Event cards can only be used by a player if they
apply to a Nation or Characters they control.

—

—

—

—

The Saruman and Sauron Allies player controls the
Isengard and Southron & Easterling Nations, as well
as Saruman.

Any player may hunt the Fellowship.

Any player may move the Nazgûl, but only the
Witch-king player may recruit new Nazgûl.

The number of Action dice allocated to the Hunt
Box before the Action die roll is decided by the
Leading Player.

MIXED ARMIES
If, after an action, units and Leaders controlled by different
players are in the same region, they may remain as separate
Armies or a mixed Army can result.

If the Armies remain separate, each player keeps the control
of his own units and Leaders. If the total number of units
of the two Armies exceeds the stacking limit, the players
must remove one unit each, starting with the non-Leading
player, until the limit is respected.

The troops of the two players may become a mixed Army if
both players agree to this; they must become a mixed Army
if the region is attacked.

The controlling player of a mixed Army is the player who
controls the highest number of Army units in the region.
In the case of a tie, the player with the highest number of
Elite units is the controlling player. If there is still a tie, the
current Leading Player is the controlling player.

Only the controlling player may use actions to move or
attack with the mixed Army, and play Combat cards for
that Army.

If the number of units changes, the control of the mixed
Army may be transferred to the other player. Note,
however, that the controlling player may not deliberately
split an Army (during either movement or attack) so that he
loses the control of the acting Army.

A player may regain control of his units in a mixed Army
by simply using an action to move these units out of the
region with the mixed Army.

A mixed Army is still subject to the political restrictions
(such as not being able to move across another border) of
any non-belligerent Nation that is part of a mixed Army.

The icon in the lower right corner of the Event portion of a
card indicates which player may use that card.

Cards that do not have an icon may be used by any player
as appropriate.

SOUTHRON & EASTERLING ELITE UNITS
In a multiplayer game, when Saruman is in play, each
Southron & Easterling Elite unit, as well as each Isengard
Elite unit, is considered a Leader as well as an Army unit for
all movement and combat purposes.

THREE-PLAYER GAME
The three-player game uses the same rules as the four-
player game, but there is only one Free Peoples player, who
plays normally as in a standard two-player game, with the
following exception:

—

The Free Peoples player cannot use two consecutive
actions on the same Nation (e.g., he cannot use two
consecutive actions to recruit and move Gondor
troops). He can use two consecutive actions on
mixed Armies but not on the same individual Army
(e.g., he can move a Gondor Army once and then a
Gondor/Rohan Army, but cannot act twice with the
same Gondor/Rohan Army).

VICTORY CONDITIONS
Each team wins as in the two-player game. To assess
individual victory within a team:

—

—

If the Shadow team wins, count the Victory point
value of Strongholds and Cities captured by the
Nations of each Shadow player and subtract the
Victory points of Strongholds and Cities they lost.
The player with the highest total wins.

If the Free Peoples team wins, the player who lost
fewer Victory points for Strongholds and Cities
conquered by the Shadow wins.
