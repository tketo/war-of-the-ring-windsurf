# War of the Ring Rules Guide v2.5 (Base Game Edition)

*Note*: Version 2.5 corrects Russian text in **Armies and Battles > Combat** and **Fortifications, Cities, and Sieges** to English, ensuring consistency. Retains v2.4 updates: removes Palantir die from Event Cards Drawing, clarifies its use to draw/play cards in Action Resolution under Event Cards Playing. Preserves victory conditions from v2.3: military victories (Shadow: 10+ VP; Free Peoples: 4+ VP with Shadow <10) checked in Phase 6, Ring (FP: Mount Doom with <12 Corruption) and Corruption (SP: Corruption = 12) immediate. Maintains multiplayer rules for 3- and 4-player games (team setups, card drawing, hand limits, leader mechanics, mixed armies), Game Turn (dice recovery, card drawing), Elven Rings (3 FP counters flipped to Shadow box), Political Track (3 peace boxes, nation positions), and Characters from v1.9: 7 Companions (Gandalf the Grey, Strider, Boromir, Legolas, Gimli, Peregrin, Meriadoc), Frodo and Sam as Ring-bearers, Gandalf the White and Aragorn as non-Companions, Gollum as a special Character, and Minions (Saruman, Witch-king, Mouth of Sauron). Maintains settlement details (36 settlements: 16 strongholds, 6 cities, 14 towns; Free Peoples: 20 VP, Shadow: 18 VP, total 38 VP), including Folde as a Free Peoples’ town, Umbar as a Shadow stronghold, Nurn as a Shadow town, Pelargir as a city, and Osgiliath as a Free-controlled fortification. Includes “Free Region” definition. Excludes implementation details, reserving them for a future implementation guide. Maintains shared Action Dice pools, siege stacking, and combat rules.

  4. **Remove Casualties**: Attacker removes first:
     - 1 hit = 1 Regular removed.
     - 2 hits = 1 Elite removed.
     - 1 hit = replace Elite with Regular from reinforcements (Shadow: reinforcements, Free Peoples: dead pile if available).
     - 1 hit = remove Elite if no replacements.
     - Free Peoples units/leaders/Companions/Characters removed permanently (except Gandalf the White, Hobbits via abilities); Shadow units/Nazgûl to reinforcements; Minions removed permanently.
     - Companions/Characters/Minions die only with their army; if all units die, remove leaders/Nazgûl/Companions/Characters/Minions.
  5. **Stopping or Retreating**: 
     - Attacker decides to continue; if not, army stays in region.
     - If continuing, defender may retreat to an adjacent Free Region or Stronghold (besieged if in same region).
     - No retreat into enemy army or controlled Settlement; army stays if no retreat possible.

## Fortifications, Cities, and Sieges
### Fortifications and Cities
- **Function**: Identical in combat; located at Osgiliath and Fords of Isen.
- **Combat**: First round, attacker hits on 6, defender on 5; subsequent rounds, both hit on 5-6.
- **Control**: Osgiliath (Free, 2 Regular), Fords of Isen (Free, 2 Regular, 1 Leader).

### Strongholds and Sieges
- **Field to Siege**: Army in a Stronghold region (e.g., Minas Tirith, Umbar) may fight a field battle or retreat into siege before any round; move defenders to Stronghold box, battle ends, attacker may advance.
- **Siege Rules**:
  - Max 5 units in Stronghold (and any number of leaders/Companions/Characters/Minions); excess removed immediately when a Stronghold comes under siege and placed in reinforcements (Shadow: reinforcements, Free Peoples: reserves, not permanent casualties). Units in reinforcements can re-enter the game later via recruitment.
  - Holds all leaders/Companions/Characters/Minions; no retreat or movement (except sortie).
  - Besieging army moves as if owning the region.
  - Siege breaks when region has no enemy units; defenders return to map.
- **Siege Battles**:
  - Use Army or Character die (if Leadership attacking, e.g., Aragorn, Mouth of Sauron); must be in Stronghold region.
  - Attacker hits on 6, defender on 5; 1 round unless extended.
  - Attacker may reduce Elite to Regular for extra round (repeat as needed).
  - If both survive, siege persists.
- **Sortie**:
  - Stronghold army attacks besiegers with Army or Character die (if Leadership, e.g., Boromir); resolved as field battle (both hit on 5-6).
  - If attackers stop, return to Stronghold; advancing places figures on map.
- **Relieving a Siege**: Adjacent Free Peoples army attacks besiegers in field battle; Stronghold army uninvolved until besiegers gone.
- **Reinforcing a Siege**: Besiegers add units via movement, not attacks.

## Politics
- **Activation**: Nation entered, attacked, or Fellowship/Companion declares in its City or Stronghold (e.g., Pelargir for Gondor, Far Harad for Southrons).
- **Advancing**: Muster die or Companion ability (e.g., Gimli in Erebor, Boromir in Minas Tirith) moves Active nation through 3 peace boxes to “At War”; battle or Settlement capture advances.
- **At War**: Armies can attack, move into other nations, muster with dice.

## Free Regions
- **Definition**: A region is Free if:
  1. It has no enemy army or enemy-controlled Settlement (e.g., Folde, Osgiliath for Free Peoples; Nurn, Umbar for Shadow).
  2. It contains an enemy Stronghold currently besieged by a friendly army.
- **Free for Movement**: Includes Free Regions, plus regions with enemy-controlled Settlements without enemy units (e.g., Angmar, no units).
- **Character Movement**: Gandalf the White moves as Level 4 alone or with Hobbit (e.g., Merry); Companions use Level + Progress Counter when separating (e.g., Legolas: 2).

## The Fellowship
- **Movement**: Character die advances Progress Counter (hidden); triggers Hunt.
- **Guide**: Highest Level (e.g., Gandalf the Grey: 3, Strider: 3; Free Peoples choose on tie); Gollum if no Companions, reveals to reduce Hunt damage by 1. Merry/Pippin separate to reduce Hunt damage by 1.
- **Corruption**: 0-12; 12 = Shadow victory (immediate).
- **Separation**: Character die; move Level + Progress Counter regions (e.g., Boromir: 2); eliminated in Mordor. Merry/Pippin return outside Mordor if eliminated in Fellowship.

## Hunt for the Ring
- **Pool**: 12 numbered (0-3, some with 👁), 4 Eye. *Note*: Special tiles added via expansions.
- **Hunt Roll**: Roll Hunt box dice (max 5); +1 per prior move this turn; success on 6+ (reroll per Shadow army, Nazgûl, or Stronghold in region).
- **Tile Effects**:
  - Number (0-3): Damage.
  - **👁**: Damage = successes, reveal.
- **Damage**: Corruption, eliminate Companion (reduce by Level, excess as Corruption; e.g., Boromir: 2).

## Mordor Track
- **Entry**: Declare in Morannon or Minas Morgul; reset Hunt Pool with Special tiles (*expansion hook*).
- **Movement**: Hidden only; draw tile per move (no roll); Eye = Hunt box Eyes + prior moves; advance through six areas (1-5, then Mount Doom).
- **Inactivity**: +1 Corruption if revealed and no move/hide all turn.
- **Companions**: Eliminated if separated in Mordor (e.g., Legolas, Gimli).

## Victory Conditions
- **Military** (checked in Phase 6):
  - Shadow wins if they hold 10+ VP in Free Peoples cities/strongholds.
  - Free Peoples win if they hold 4+ VP in Shadow cities/strongholds and Shadow has <10 VP.
- **Ring** (immediate):
  - Free Peoples win if Fellowship reaches Mount Doom with <12 Corruption.
- **Corruption** (immediate):
  - Shadow wins if Corruption = 12.
- **Team Scoring (3-4 Players)**:
  - **Shadow**: Net Score = VPs gained from enemy strongholds/cities – VPs lost from own nations.
  - **Free Peoples**: Lowest loss of Stronghold/City VPs wins.

## Edge Cases
- **Nazgûl**: Move freely unless card specifies (e.g., "The Nazgûl Strike!").
- **Siege Stacking**: Max 5 units in besieged Stronghold (any number of leaders/Companions/Characters/Minions); excess to reinforcements (Shadow: reinforcements, Free Peoples: reserves, not permanent casualties).
- **Companion Separation**: Eliminated in Mordor; if all separate, Gollum becomes Guide, placed on board.
- **Multiple Army Moves**: 2 armies, 1 region each per Army die; no splitting mid-move.
- **Stronghold Recapture**: Free Peoples recapture if no Shadow units remain after battle (e.g., Minas Tirith).
- **Character Replacement**: Strider to Aragorn (Will of the West, in Minas Tirith, Pelargir, or Dol Amroth); Gandalf the Grey to Gandalf the White (Will of the West, Shadow Minion in play, in Elven Stronghold or Fangorn).
- **Hobbit Return**: Merry/Pippin return if eliminated in Fellowship outside Mordor.

## Future Expansions and Scenarios
- **Expansions**: Placeholder for "Lords of Middle-earth," "Warriors of Middle-earth," "Kings of Middle-earth":
  - Additional cards, characters, dice, Hunt tiles.
- **Scenarios**: Placeholder for "Breaking of the Fellowship," "Treebeard":
  - Pre-configured setups.
  ## Developer Notes
- **State Tracking**: `gameState`: Include `actionDicePools` with `freePeoples: { count, results }` and `shadow: { count, results }` to track the shared dice pools for each side, encrypted in MongoDB. Remove any reference to individual player ownership of dice.
- **Rules Enforcement**: `validateMove`: Check combat card timing, Leadership forfeiture, siege transitions (e.g., Elite reduction), sortie rules, and siege stacking limits.
- **UI Components**: `ActionDiceArea`: Display shared pools for Free Peoples (blue) and Shadow (red) with no per-player attribution.
- **Testing**: Validate siege battles (6 vs. 5 hits), sortie (5-6 hits), card interactions (e.g., "Grond"), and siege stacking (excess units to reinforcements).
