# War of the Ring - Second Edition Rules - Grok3 version

## 1. Introduction

*War of the Ring* is a strategy board game for 2–4 players, simulating the conflict between the Free Peoples and the Shadow in J.R.R. Tolkien’s *The Lord of the Rings*. The Free Peoples player controls the Fellowship of the Ring and allied armies, aiming to destroy the One Ring or achieve military dominance. The Shadow player commands Sauron’s forces, seeking to conquer Middle-earth or corrupt the Ring-bearers.

- **Two-player game**: One player controls the Free Peoples, the other the Shadow.
- **Three- or four-player game**: Players form two teams, with specific roles detailed in [Section 11: Multiplayer Rules](#11-multiplayer-rules).
- This rulebook focuses on the two-player game unless otherwise specified.

   - Each player draws 1 card from each Event deck (Character and Strategy).
2. **Fellowship Phase**:
   - Free Peoples player may:
     - Declare the Fellowship’s position (only opportunity outside Hunt reveal; move Ring-bearers, reset Progress counter).
     - Heal Ring-bearers (remove 1 Corruption if declared in a Free Peoples City/Stronghold not enemy-controlled; repeatable across multiple turns by staying in the same region).
     - Activate a Nation (flip to Active if declared in its City/Stronghold).

   - Players alternate actions, starting with Free Peoples, using one Action Die result each:

     - Players may pass if they have fewer dice, or discard a die without effect.
     - Continue until all dice are used.

   - **City/Fortification**: Attacker hits on 6+ in the first round only (5+ thereafter, unless besieging); defender hits on 5+.

4. **Remove Casualties**:
   - Remove 1 unit per hit (attacker chooses first).
   - Leaders/Characters cannot be casualties.
   - Elite units may reduce to Regular to avoid elimination, taking the Regular unit from casualties or reinforcements; if none available, the Elite is eliminated (do not place counters under existing Regulars).
   - If all Army units are eliminated, all Leaders and Characters in the region are also eliminated.
5. **Leader Re-roll**:
   - Re-roll failed dice equal to Leadership (max 5).
6. **Continue or Stop**:
   - Continue for up to 5 rounds unless:
     - One Army is eliminated.
     - Defender retreats (to a free adjacent region without enemy units/control markers, a friendly Settlement captured by the enemy, or a region besieging an enemy Stronghold; or into a siege if in a Stronghold).
     - Attacker stops.
   - Defender can only retreat if the attacker continues the battle (not if attacker stops after one round).
   - Free Peoples’ Scouts Combat Card allows retreat before combat.
   - Non-“At War” units may retreat across other Nations’ borders but must leave on their next move unless “At War.”
   - **Splitting**: Attacker may leave a rearguard (at least 1 unit) before retreating; may advance only part of the Army after winning.

   - Besieged units do not participate.

## Clarifications and Notes

- **Edge Cases**:
  - **Hunt Mechanics**: Companion counters can be kept in the Fellowship Box for random casualty selection or placed in the Hunt Box to track Shadow’s allocation limit (equal to Companions, including Gollum as Guide). Re-roll conditions apply per region state at Hunt resolution, not movement start.
  - **Fellowship in Besieged Strongholds**: Can enter/leave freely, but separated Companions cannot leave; in Mordor, separation eliminates Companions, useful for absorbing Corruption.
  - **Combat Nuances**: Elite units count as 1 for Combat Strength, not 2. Combat and leadership re-rolls are separate, with distinct modifiers; 5-dice limit is absolute. For Cities/Fortifications, the attacker’s 6+ hit requirement applies only to the first round unless besieging, reverting to 5+ thereafter. For Strongholds, if the defender retreats into a siege, the attacker hits on 6+ for all rounds, reflecting the formidable defense.
  - **Retreat Restrictions**: Defender cannot retreat if attacker stops after one round; Scouts card enables pre-combat retreat; non-“At War” units crossing borders during retreat must exit unless “At War” by next move.
  - **Siege Dynamics**: Siege begins only when defender retreats into a Stronghold, ending the current battle; siege combat requires a separate action, with attacker hitting on 6+ for all rounds unless modified by cards. Defender chooses field battle (both hit on 5+) or siege before each round, offering tactical flexibility.
  - **Action Dice Triggers**: Extra dice are tied to specific Characters (Aragorn – Heir to Isildur, Gandalf the White, Minions), lost upon elimination, reflecting their narrative weight.
  - **Event Card Interactions**: “Attack” cards fully simulate battles for political effects; partial card effects encourage flexible play, but recruitment fails in enemy-controlled/present regions unless explicitly allowed.
- **April 2025 Update**:
  - No rule changes; community notes clarify combat strength, retreat conditions, and Companion counter usage, aligning with official rules. Official rules confirm City/Fortification first-round mechanics (attacker 6+ only in first round) and Stronghold siege mechanics (attacker 6+ for all siege rounds).
- **Design Nuances**:
  - Asymmetrical dice pools balance Free Peoples’ defensive focus against Shadow’s aggression, with Elven Rings offering limited but critical flexibility.
  - Political Track enforces Free Peoples’ reluctance, countered by Companion activation, creating strategic tension between military and Fellowship goals.
  - Hunt system escalates risk with Fellowship movement, balanced by Guide abilities and casualty options; Mordor Track’s deterministic tiles heighten endgame pressure.
