## Region & Settlement Definitions

### Free Region
A region is **Free** if:
1. It has no enemy Army or enemy-controlled Settlement, **OR**
2. It contains an *enemy Stronghold* currently besieged by a friendly Army.

### Free (for movement purposes)
Includes:
- Any Free Region
- Regions with enemy-controlled settlements *without* enemy units

---

## Settlement Control and Capture

### Initial Control
- Settlements begin under control of the Nation in whose borders they lie.
- These are considered **Unconquered** and are valid for:
  - Mustering troops (if at War)
  - Advancing the Political Track

### Losing Control (Captured)
Occurs when:
1. Enemy units move into an undefended friendly settlement.
2. A siege or battle eliminates all defenders and enemy units move in.
3. Friendly units retreat, and enemy units move into the region.

> Note: A **besieged Stronghold** is *not* captured until all defenders are eliminated.

### Effects of Capture
- Place enemy faction marker over the original icon.
- If a **City** or **Stronghold**, the capturer gains Victory Points:
  - City = 1 VP
  - Stronghold = 2 VP
- Enemy retains control even if units leave.
- Enemy *cannot* muster from conquered settlements.
- Original player may recapture, removing marker and restoring control + VP.
