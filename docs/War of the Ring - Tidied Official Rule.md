## Opening Excerpt

Everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war. The Misty Mountains were crawling like anthills; Orcs were issuing out of a thousand holes. Under the boughs of Mirkwood there was deadly strife among Elves, Men, and fell beasts. The land of the Beornings was aflame; a cloud was over Moria; smoke rose on the borders of Lórien. Horsemen galloped across the grass of Rohan; wolves poured from Isengard. From the havens of Harad, ships of war put out to sea; and from the East, Men were moving endlessly – swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon horses, chariots of chieftains, and laden wains. All the power of the Dark Lord was in motion.

## Chapter I: Introduction

### Welcome

Welcome to the War of the Ring strategy board game. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s *The Lord of the Rings™*, this game is designed for two to four players. Players take part in the struggle between the heroic Companions of the Fellowship of the Ring (Free Peoples) and the dark, mighty forces of the Shadow.

- **Two Players:** One controls the Free Peoples and the other the Shadow armies.
- **Three Players:** One controls the Free Peoples while the remaining two share the responsibilities of the Shadow.
- **Four Players:** All participants evenly share the forces of the two opposing sides.

In each game the Shadow player uses superior military power to conquer Middle-earth—commanding Sauron’s legions of Orcs and Trolls, forces of the wizard Saruman, and the hosts of the Southrons and Easterlings. In contrast, the Free Peoples player unites Elves, Dwarves, the riders of Rohan, men of Gondor, and men from the North. Meanwhile, the nine Companions of the Fellowship journey toward Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Victory is achieved when either side meets its objectives:
- **Shadow Victory:** If enough enemy cities and strongholds are conquered or if the Ring-bearers are corrupted.
- **Free Peoples Victory:** If the Fellowship destroys the Ring or the Free Peoples turn the tide by conquering key enemy strongholds.

*Please note: These rules refer to games played with two players. For multiplayer rules (more than two players), see Chapter 11 (Multiplayer Rules).*

## Chapter III: Setting Up the Game

Before play begins, decide which player controls the Free Peoples and which controls the Shadow. Then follow these steps:

1. **Place the Game Board:**  
   Choose a large enough surface to accommodate the board, discarded cards, eliminated pieces, and dice rolls.

2. **Place the Ring-bearers:**  
   Position the Ring-bearers’ figure on Rivendell (their starting point).

3. **Set Up the Fellowship Track:**  
   Place the Fellowship Progress Counter on Step 0 (with the “Hidden” side up) and place the Corruption Counter on Step 0.

4. **Arrange the Companion Cards:**  
   Place all Companion Cards in the Guide of the Fellowship Box with the Gandalf the Grey card on top. Set aside the cards for Aragorn – Heir to Isildur, Gandalf the White, and Gollum.

5. **Place the Companion Figures:**  
   Put all Companion figures and their counters into the Fellowship Box. Reserve the Gollum figure for later use.

6. **Place the Elven Ring Counters:**  
   Place the three Elven Ring counters in the Free Peoples’ Elven Rings Box (with the Ring side up).

7. **Set Aside Shadow Minion Cards:**  
   Remove the Shadow Minion Cards (Witch-king, Saruman, and the Mouth of Sauron) along with their figures for later use.

8. **Sort Event Cards:**  
   Separate Free Peoples and Shadow Event Cards into Character and Strategy decks, shuffle them, and place them on the board in their designated areas.

9. **Prepare the Hunt Tiles:**  
   Place the Standard (beige) Hunt Tiles in an opaque container as the Hunt Pool and set aside the Special (blue and red) Hunt Tiles.

10. **Distribute Action Dice:**  
    Give the Shadow player seven red Action Dice and the Free Peoples player four blue Action Dice. Set aside any additional dice (including the five Combat Dice).

11. **Place Political Counters:**  
    Place each Free Peoples Nation’s Political Counter at its starting point on the Political Track. All counters (except for the Elves) start “Passive,” while the Elven and Shadow Army Nations’ counters start “Active.” Organize them in the designated boxes based on the board symbols.

12. **Army Setup:**  
    Sort all plastic figures by color and type and follow the Army Setup diagram (pages 16–17 in the rulebook) to place each Nation’s initial Army Units and Leaders. Set aside extra figures as reinforcements and reserve Army Counters for later use.

## Chapter IV: The Game Turn

War of the Ring is played over a series of turns until one side wins. Each turn is divided into six phases:

1. **Recover Action Dice and Draw Event Cards:**  
   - Recover all Action Dice used in the previous turn (adjusting for any additions or removals).  
   - Each player draws 2 cards (one from each Event deck).

2. **Fellowship Phase:**  
   - The Free Peoples player declares the Fellowship’s position.  
   - If declared in a City or Stronghold of a Free Peoples Nation, that Nation is activated (flip to “Active”) and the Ring-bearers may be healed.  
   - The Free Peoples player may also change the Fellowship’s Guide.

3. **Hunt Allocation:**  
   - The Shadow player places a number of Action Dice into the Hunt Box.  
   - He must place at least 1 if any Fellowship Action Dice were in the Hunt Box previously and may allocate only as many dice as there are Companions in the Fellowship.

4. **Action Roll:**  
   - Players roll all remaining Action Dice (the Shadow player does not roll dice in the Hunt Box).  
   - Any die showing the “Eye” result on the Shadow side is immediately moved into the Hunt Box.

5. **Action Resolution:**  
   - Players alternate actions, starting with the Free Peoples player.  
   - On each turn, a player selects one of their available dice and immediately carries out the corresponding action.  
   - If the Free Peoples player uses an Action Die to move the Fellowship, that die is placed in the Hunt Box after the action.
   - When a player runs out of actions, the opponent executes any remaining actions consecutively.

6. **Victory Check:**  
   - Both players check for achievement of Military (or Ring-based) Victory Conditions.  
   - *(Note: If a Ring-based Victory condition occurs at any point, the game ends immediately.)*

### Action Dice Details

- **Total Dice Pool:**  
  - The Shadow player starts with 7 dice (can gain up to 10).  
  - The Free Peoples player starts with 4 dice (gains one for Aragorn – Heir to Isildur and one for Gandalf the White).

- **Hunt Allocation and Roll:**  
  - During Hunt Allocation, the Shadow places dice in the Hunt Box (subject to limits based on the number of Companions).  
  - During Action Roll, the Shadow rolls the remaining dice; all “Eye” results are moved to the Hunt Box.

- **Using Action Dice:**  
  - Dice are used to perform various actions (see the Action Dice Reference Chart below).  
  - Once used (except for Fellowship movement, which places the die in the Hunt Box), dice are set aside until the next turn.

### The Elven Rings

At the start of the game, the Free Peoples player receives three Elven Ring counters, kept in the Elven Rings Box with the Ring side up. When an Elven Ring is used:

- After the Shadow player uses the counter, it is discarded.
- **Usage:**

  - The Free Peoples player cannot use an Elven Ring to change a die to a “Will of the West” result.
  - The Shadow player may use an Elven Ring to change a die result into an “Eye” result, moving that die immediately to the Hunt Box.

*(Source: :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8})*

## Chapter V: The Event Cards

Event Cards capture various key episodes and unexpected occurrences from the lore. They may be used normally during Action Resolution or as Combat Cards during battles.

### Event Decks

Each player has two decks:
- **Strategy Deck:** Offers military and political options.
- **Character Deck:** Often relates to the Fellowship and character actions.

### Drawing and Holding Cards

- During the first phase of each turn, each player draws one card from each deck.
- Players may hold a maximum of six cards; any extras must be discarded face down.
- If a deck is depleted, discarded cards are not reshuffled.

### Playing Event Cards

Event Cards may be played in two ways:
1. **Using an Event Action Die:** (Palantir symbol)
2. **Matching the Icon:** Using an Action Die result that corresponds to the symbol in the upper right corner of the card.

Generally, Event Cards are discarded immediately after their effects are resolved unless the text indicates “Play on the table” (meaning their effect remains until a condition is met).

#### Example Card Format

- **Event Title:** Wizard’s Staff  
- **Card Type:** Character  
- **Pre-condition:** Play on the table if Gandalf the Grey is in the Fellowship.  
- **Event Text:** Discard this card to prevent the Shadow player from drawing a Hunt tile.  
- **Discard Condition:** Discard immediately if Gandalf the Grey leaves the Fellowship.  
- **Combat Usage:** (e.g., Servant of the Secret Fire – add 1 to all dice on your Combat roll when Gandalf is in the battle.)
