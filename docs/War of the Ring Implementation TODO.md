# War of the Ring Implementation TODO List v1.9

*Updated for AI Automation, Undo/Redo, Schema Sharing, Multiplayer, Utility Functions, and Separate Region/Army Setup Files*

**Note**: Version 1.9 aligns with PRD v1.3, Rules Guide v1.4, and Implementation Guide v2.2. This list provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to developing the War of the Ring Web App, covering project setup, backend and frontend development, game logic, state management, multiplayer functionality, AI integration, and testing. It ensures compliance with all requirements, including undo/redo functionality, schema sharing via Quicktype, 3/4-player rules, shared Action Dice pools (`actionDiceArea.free` for Free Peoples with 4 dice, `actionDiceArea.shadow` for Shadow with 7 dice), and siege stacking (max 5 units, excess to `offBoard.reserves`). Separate files (`regions.json` for static region data and `initial_army_setup.json` for starting units and control) enhance modularity.

---

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] **Initialize Backend Project**
  - [ ] Create a directory named `war-of-the-ring-backend`.
  - [ ] Run `npm init -y` to initialize the project with default settings.
  - [ ] Install dependencies: `npm install express socket.io mongoose redis crypto clerk-sdk-node`.
  - [ ] Set up `server.js` with Express and HTTPS, using self-signed certificates for development.
- [ ] **Initialize Frontend Project**
  - [ ] Create a directory named `war-of-the-ring-frontend`.
  - [ ] Create an `index.html` file in the frontend directory.
  - [ ] Add CDN links for React (`cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react@18`), React DOM (`react-dom@18`), Babel, `react-i18next`, `reduxjs/toolkit`, and Tailwind CSS.
  - [ ] Add a `<div id="root">` element in `index.html` as the mount point for React.

---

## 2. Backend Setup
- [ ] **Configure Server**
  - [ ] Enforce HTTPS for both Express and `socket.io` to secure communication.
  - [ ] Integrate Clerk for authentication using `clerk-sdk-node`.
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting and logging to mitigate DDoS attacks.
- [ ] **Database Setup**
  - [ ] Configure MongoDB with AES-256 encryption for secure data storage.
  - [ ] Define Mongoose schemas for:
    - Game state (including `history` with `committed: Boolean`, `actionDiceArea`, `siegeStatus`, `offBoard.reserves`).
    - Cards (event and combat).
    - Characters (with `playableBy` field distinct from nations).
  - [ ] Seed MongoDB with:
    - 96 event cards from `eventcards.json`.
    - 62 combat cards from `combatcards.json`.
    - 13 characters from `characters.json`.
    - Static region data from `regions.json` (names, nation codes).
    - Base game army setup from `initial_army_setup.json` (units, leaders, control, siege status).
  - [ ] Validate that `initial_army_setup.json` references valid region IDs from `regions.json`.
  - [ ] Set up Redis for session management to support multiplayer functionality.
- [ ] **Encryption**
  - [ ] Implement AES-256 encryption and decryption functions using the `crypto` module.
  - [ ] Test encryption with a sample game state to verify data security.
- [ ] **Schema Sharing**
  - [ ] Install Quicktype globally: `npm install -g quicktype`.
  - [ ] Create a script to generate TypeScript types from the game state schema (refer to Implementation Guide v2.2, Game State Model).

---

## 3. Game State and Rules Engine
- [ ] **Define Game State**
  - [ ] Create a Mongoose schema for the game state with:
    - `actionDiceArea` for shared dice pools (`free` for Free Peoples with 4 dice, `shadow` for Shadow with 7 dice).
    - `siegeStatus` for regions.
    - `offBoard.reserves` for excess siege units.
    - `history` with `committed: Boolean`.
    - `playerCount` for 1-4 players.
  - [ ] Ensure no `owner` field exists in `actionDiceArea` to enforce shared pool logic.
  - [ ] Initialize `board.regions` by merging:
    - `regions.json` (static data: names, nation codes).
    - `initial_army_setup.json` (units, leaders, control, siege status).
    - Place the Fellowship in Rivendell with all base game Companions.
  - [ ] Set up the Redux store with the initial game state, using generated TypeScript types for consistency.
- [ ] **Implement Rules Engine**
  - [ ] Develop a `validateMove` function to check action legality, using `actionDiceArea.free` or `actionDiceArea.shadow`, with:
    - `playableBy` restrictions for 3/4-player character plays.
    - Siege stacking rules (max 5 units, excess to `offBoard.reserves` immediately upon siege start).
  - [ ] Create a `resolveAction` utility function to:
    - Process actions.
    - Update shared dice pools.
    - Advance turn order.
    - Transition game state (e.g., to "Military Victory" when both pools are empty).
  - [ ] Manage persistent card states (e.g., 4-player hand size limit of 4 cards).
  - [ ] Enforce 3-player Free Peoples restriction: no consecutive actions with the same nation or army.
  - [ ] Test the rules engine with scenarios from Implementation Guide v2.2 (siege stacking, shared dice pools, character abilities).
